**IMPORTANT: READ THIS FIRST**

**This training is designed to teach volunteer advocates how to provide competent, effective crisis intervention services to victims and survivors of sexual assault.**

**This training is meant to supplement, and not replace, formal training for rape crisis counseling offered at rape crisis centers. Completion does not certify trainees as advocates or counselors.**

**However, we acknowledge that because these services may be limited in your community, if you seek to serve as an advocate but no training is available, it may be helpful to consult this digital training as a guide.**

**This training presents basic supportive listening skills that can be used without advanced training. This training in no way teaches the skills necessary to provide counseling therapy.**

**By continuing, you acknowledge that you understand the limits of this digital training.**

1.  **GETTING STARTED**
2.  **During the Training**

**Due to the sensitive nature of this training material, it is important to take care of yourself while you are learning.**

Here are some suggestions for self-care as you navigate what can be triggering and upsetting information:

_- Take it slow and move at a pace that feels comfortable to you._

_- Make more time for relaxing and doing activities that you enjoy._

_- Make sure to get enough rest, drink plenty of water and nourish yourself with healthy food._

_- If you feel strong feelings because of the training, take a few minutes to focus on slowing down your breathing. Exhale longer than your inhale and feel yourself breathing from your belly. Do this for a few minutes, until your strong feelings have passed._

1.  **Victim or Survivor?**

It is up to the individuals themselves to determine when the shift from _victim_ to _survivor_ occurs. Some people feel they are survivors from the moment they escape from the assailant and they may prefer the term _survivor_ to be used immediately.

Other individuals use the term _survivor_ to signify that they have made progress regaining control of their lives and recovering from the experience. These individuals may resent being called _survivors_ too soon and prefer that advocates recognize that they were victimized because in the early stages, they feel like victims and not survivors.

**In this material, we use the term _survivor_ because this emphasizes the survivor-centered approach of advocacy and the agency and power of the survivor of sexual assault.**

1.  **What is Advocacy?**

**Advocacy empowers survivors of sexual assault.**

On an individual level, advocacy helps survivors of sexual assault ensure that their voices are heard and their rights are respected.

On an organizational level, advocacy focuses on changing behaviors, attitudes, values or policies so that all survivors’ rights are recognized and respected.

At its most basic, advocacy provides survivors with information about their options so that they can make educated choices. Advocacy ultimately encourages survivors to advocate for themselves, while giving them a voice when they are too weak to speak.

**Sexual assault advocacy helps survivors to cope with the event of a sexual assault and addresses safety issues and risks that survivors face.**

In this training, we focus on sexual assault advocacy in a medical setting, as a survivor presents at a hospital emergency room or health center to receive treatment.

**Crisis intervention focuses on helping the individual develop an action plan and connect to appropriate support.**

In your community, it is important to know which resources are available and appropriate for follow-up support.

1.  **What Advocates Do**

**The core of advocacy is to listen and believe. The healing power of this is extraordinary.**

Survivors do not need to prove that they are suffering to win support; advocates give unconditional support while safeguarding the individual’s right to be treated with respect, whatever the circumstance.

The unfortunate reality is that an advocate may be the only person who believes a survivor without question, comment, or blame, which makes phrases, “I believe you,” and “It wasn’t your fault,” that much more powerful.

The rare case when a survivor is dishonest is relatively unimportant. Clearly, the survivor is suffering on some level and has most likely been victimized in some way. In this instance, being deceived is a small price to pay for extending the healing power of unconditional belief that has helped so many survivors.

**Another core piece of advocacy is to neither investigate nor judge.**

Asking questions so that the account makes sense to you can jeopardize your relationship with the survivor. Leave the investigation to the investigators.

This means no note-taking while the survivor talks about the assault. Keeping your hands free while the survivor is talking is an important way to use body language to communicate to the survivor that you’re not “taking” anything (like taking notes or taking a report), but rather you are being present as a trusted ally.

**Advocates are the only first responders who have no other responsibilities and no pressing agenda.**

*   1.  **Teamwork**

To meet survivors’ needs, advocates need to work with others, from medical professionals to law enforcement officers.

In addition to supporting the survivor, your effectiveness is measured by how well you cooperate with the wider team.

**This is especially challenging in contexts where sexual assault is not treated as a crime or with professionals who blame the survivor for the sexual assault.**

Especially where the medical response to sexual assault survivors is insensitive, or where first responders are not educated about how to provide services to sexual assault survivors, having an advocate accompanying the survivor can make their care-seeking experiences less traumatic.

1.  **Overview of Sexual Assault**

Because sexual assault survivors can be any gender, we will use “they” and “them” to refer to survivors.

To help us understand the vocabulary, we are going to explore definitions of sexual assault and sexual violence.

**In this training, we will use “sexual assault” to cover any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without someone’s explicit consent.**

This includes sexual activities such as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, attempted rape and rape.

**Sexual assault does not discriminate. It can happen anywhere, to anyone.**

Survivors of sexual assault come from all genders, races, ethnicities, cultural backgrounds, religions and economic levels.

More than 85% of all sexual assaults are committed by someone the survivor knows. While the stereotype of sexual assault in a dark alley does happen, more often the perpetrator is a friend, a date, a family member, a coworker, a student, neighbor or casual acquaintance.

*   1.  **Defining Sexual Violence**

**Sexual violence is any sexual activity without a person’s consent and involves a range of behaviors, from non-touching to touching.**

Try to think about sexual violence as a spectrum, rather than a ranking, to avoid unintentionally evaluating the severity of the sexual violence, as this invalidates the survivor’s experience and feelings.

Sexual violence includes:

_- A completed sex act (also called rape_**_)_**_, defined as penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without someone’s consent._

_- An attempted (but not completed) sex act._

_- Abusive sexual contact, including intentional touching, directly or through the clothing, of the genitals, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttocks of any person without their consent, or of a person who is unable to consent or refuse._

_- Non-contact sexual abuse, which includes voyeurism, exhibitionism, unwanted exposure to pornography, sexual harassment, threats of sexual violence, or taking nude photos without someone’s consent or if that person is unable to consent or refuse._

*   *   1.  **Non-Physical Contact Sexual Violence**

Although most of the time we think that sexual violence is about contact, there are far more non-contact examples of sexual violence.

Examples include:

_- Verbal comments about private parts of the body_

_- Sexual rumors and name-calling_

_- Making sexual requests or jokes_

_- Whistling and catcalling_

_- Sexual gestures_

_- Peeping_

_- Flashing or leering at someone_

It can also include writing, like posting comments online or texting, and sending photos or videos.

Someone in a position of power can offer something in exchange for sexual behavior, and in communicating this is guilty of non-touching sexual violence.

*   *   1.  **Sexual Violence with Physical Contact**

Examples of sexual violence with contact include:

_- Touching or grabbing private parts of the body_

_- Rubbing or grinding against someone_

_- Cornering them (using their body to prevent someone from leaving a room or space, or pressing somebody up against a wall)_

_- Pulling clothes_

_- Rape_

_- Sexual assault_

_- Drug-facilitated sexual assault_

_- Child sexual abuse_

**Looking at this list, most of us can probably find something that’s happened to us or to someone we know.**

Think, for a moment, about how upsetting and harmful this may have been.

While you might say, “I’ve never been raped,” as someone who has experienced or who knows someone who has experienced sexual violence, you can still empathize with survivors’ experiences and feelings.

*   1.  **Defining Sexual Assault**

**Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.**

At any point during sexual activity, someone has the right to say no. Even in the middle of any sexual behavior, they have the right to say, “No. I don’t want to do this anymore,” and the behavior must stop.

**If the behavior continues, or if there is manipulation or coercion and the behavior continues, that is sexual assault.**

The term sexual assault covers a wide range of unwanted behaviors that do not include penetration and that are attempted or completed against someone’s will or when someone cannot consent because of age, disability, or the influence of alcohol or drugs. It may involve actual or threatened physical force, including the use of weapons, coercion, intimidation or pressure.

It can include:

- _Intentional touching of someone’s genitals, anus, groin or breasts_

_- Voyeurism_

_- Exposure to exhibitionism_

_- Undesired exposure to pornography_

_- Public display of images that were taken in a private context or when someone was unaware_

Drug-facilitated sexual assault is when a person has sex with someone after they have been administered drugs, intoxicants or other means to prevent resistance, without their knowledge.

Sexual assault can also be when there is sexual behavior with someone living with a mental disability, when the disability renders them incapable of giving consent.

*   1.  **False Beliefs about Sexual Assault**

Many people in society have attitudes and beliefs about sexual assault that are false but that are used to deny and justify sexual assault.

**The core false belief is that sexual assault is driven by passion rather than power and control.**

These false beliefs seek to blame the survivor for sexual assault, rather than putting responsibility where it belongs, with the perpetrator.

Examples include:

_- Telling someone that they are exaggerating the physical, emotional and mental impact of sexual assault._

_- Implying that if the survivor did not fight the perpetrator, that it is not sexual assault._

_- That the survivor caused the sexual assault by the way they were dressed._

_- That if the perpetrator did not have a weapon, it does not qualify as sexual assault._

_- That if it happened in the survivor’s neighborhood, it does not qualify as sexual assault._

_- That sexual assault happened because the perpetrator lost control of themselves._

_- That anyone who dresses in a certain way is inviting sexual assault._

_- That sexual assault is a result of the perpetrator’s out-of-control sex drive._

_- That the survivor caused the sexual assault by the way they were behaving._

_- That the survivor caused the sexual assault because they were drinking._

Here are some facts about sexual assault:

_- Men are more likely than women to hold false beliefs about sexual assault._

_- Men who hold false beliefs about sexual assault are more likely to hold negative attitudes towards women. They are also more likely to commit sexual assault._

_- People who hold false beliefs about sexual assault are more likely to accept interpersonal and intimate partner violence._

*   1.  **Preventing Sexual Violence**

**All parts of society must work together to end sexual violence.**

Individuals, families and communities from numerous sectors have a role to play, including education, the media, public health, criminal justice and social services.

Strategies and approaches to prevent sexual violence include:

_- Promoting social norms that protect against violence, for example bystander approaches and mobilizing men and boys as allies._

_- Teaching skills to prevent sexual violence, for example teaching healthy, safe dating and intimate relationship skills to adolescents, promoting healthy sexuality, and empowerment training._

_- Provide opportunities to empower and support women and girls, for example, strengthening economic support for women and families, and strengthening leadership opportunities for girls._

_- Create protective environments, for example improving safety and monitoring in schools, establishing and consistently applying workplace policies, and addressing community-level risks in the environment._

_- Support survivors to lessen harm, for example, providing survivor-centered services, treating survivors of sexual violence, and treating at-risk children and families to prevent problem behavior, including sex offending._

*   1.  **Bystander Intervention**

Bystanders are people in situations where they see potentially dangers situations or sexual violence happening.

**Bystanders have an opportunity to get involved and in many cases, to prevent sexual violence.**

Social norms that we have learned from our culture tell us that that when we see sexual violence happening around us, we should not get involved because the incident does not directly concern us.

Perhaps we want to help, but are afraid. We might think that if we do help, something bad might happen and we prefer to do nothing rather than doing the wrong thing. We might think that despite what we’re seeing, we don’t know the situation or what’s going on. We may be afraid that the perpetrator will becoming violent towards us.

We may say to ourselves, “This looks bad. This shouldn’t be happening. This is wrong.” But it can be scary to step in and try to prevent a situation from getting worse.

**The more people who witness a situation, the less likely they are to get involved because each person thinks that it is someone else’s responsibility.**

This is called the **bystander effect** and it has been researched extensively.

If you have ever taken a first-aid course, this is why the trainers tell you to point at someone and say “Call the ambulance,” and to tell other people specifically how they can help you. If we don’t do that, others will stand there and assume that someone else will help, so they don’t have to do anything.

Often, bystanders deny the physical intuition that tells us that something is wrong and that it will get worse if we don’t do something. Our body has natural instincts to sense danger for a reason, and we need to pay attention to it not only when we’re in danger but also to keep others safe.

False beliefs about sexual violence are another reason people don’t get involved, because the perpetrator or others may use these false beliefs to excuse their behavior. Although false beliefs about sexual assault attempt to blame the survivor for the crime, but it is always the perpetrator who is responsible for sexual violence.

It is very unlikely that we will ever be faced with an opportunity to stop a rape in progress; this is not where we want to focus our attempts to intervene.

**We want to focus on the other end of the spectrum, on the occasions of verbal comments, unwanted contact and other high-frequency events.**

**These are situations where for most of us, it’s very easy to intervene because these situations often happen with people we know.**

By intervening in these contexts, we are helping to set social norms that say that sexual violence is not acceptable within our group.

*   *   1.  **Intervention Steps**

**Whenever we intervene, we want to stay safe.**

We do not want to intervene directly when there is a chance that someone could get injured or hurt. In these cases, it is best to get others involved as a group and let an authority know what is happening while we keep a safe distance.

The most unsafe way to intervene is to get very close to the perpetrator and raise your voice to call attention to their behavior, as this could cause the perpetrator to focus their aggression on you. Whenever you consider intervening, it is essential to consider your safety first.

**It’s important to think through the steps before you intervene.**

1\. _Notice the behavior_: This is usually easy because when we see something happening, it catches our attention.

2\. _Interpret it as a problem_: Most of us know when something has the potential to turn into a problem.

3\. _Assume responsibility_: This is more difficult, because we can always find many reasons not to intervene, hoping that someone else will do it. Our default response is usually to try to distance ourselves from the situation.

4\. _Chose how to intervene_: Make a conscious choice about what the best way is to get involved. Can you involve others, so that you stay safe in the situation? What is the next step? There are many ways to intervene, including calling emergency services or notifying an authority.

5\. _Attempt to help_: It is important that we put whatever choice we have made about how to intervene into action. It is difficult to step outside yourself to help another person, especially if they are a stranger.

*   *   1.  **Intervention Options**

**Often, we do not intervene because we are not sure how to help.**

It can help to think about intervening as a range of options, for example:

_- Creating a distraction_

_- Changing the conversation_

_- Changing an interaction_

_- Or doing whatever we can to interrupt what is happening and allow others to step in and intervene._

**Intervention is best done with others involved.**

Are there friends or other bystanders who are willing to get involved?

**Alerting an authority figure is a safe and effective way to intervene.**

This could mean calling the police, or if you are in a restaurant or a business, letting the manager know what is going on. In school, this could mean talking to a teacher, counselor or principal about what is happening so that they can step in and handle the situation.

**Addressing the survivor can also be a way to intervene.**

For example, you could ask them if they are okay or if they need help. You could tell them that you are concerned about them, or that you think that they are too intoxicated to be able to consent, and offer to help them leave the immediate environment.

If it seems safe, you can also address the potential perpetrator – but if you do this, there is a risk that they could create a problem with you by fighting or becoming violent.

If we know the perpetrator, we can speak to their behavior in the moment. If they are intoxicated, get them away from the situation by creating a distraction or going to do something else, and then talking about their behavior later.

**Intervention is whatever you can do in the moment to keep everybody safe.**

It can help to explore what you think safe behavior and consent look like, and what it looks like when behaviors cross the line into something that is done without another person’s consent and that can become abusive.

Intervention can happen at many times and in many places.

We need to be able to intervene when we see non-consensual behavior before it moves into the area of abusive behavior.

**If we intervene early, we can prevent the incident from becoming worse while setting social norms for how people should be acting.**

1.  **Overview of Intimate Partner Violence**

**Intimate partner violence is one of the most common forms of violence against women.**

It occurs in all counties, all cultures and all parts of society, among all cultural, religious and socioeconomic groups.

It can affect all ages, from adolescents to the elderly, at whatever age that someone has an intimate partner.

Although all genders can be perpetrators of intimate partner violence, men are the most common perpetrators and women are the majority of survivors.

*   1.  **What is Intimate Partner Violence?**

**Intimate partner violence includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse and controlling behaviors by an intimate partner.**

It can include:

_- Physical violence such as slapping, hitting, kicking or beating._

_- Sexual violence including rape or other forms of sexual coercion._

_- Emotional or psychological abuse, such as insults, belittling, constant humiliation, intimidation (for example, destroying things), threats of harm or threats to take away children._

_- Controlling behaviors including isolating someone from family and friends, monitoring their movements and restricting their access to financial resources, employment, education or medical care._

**Different types of intimate partner violence often coexist.**

Physical intimate partner violence is often accompanied by sexual and emotional intimate partner violence. The majority of survivors who report experiencing intimate partner violence also report experiencing emotional intimate partner violence as well.

People in the LGBTQIA community also experience intimate partner violence. It can be helpful to remind LGBTQIA survivors that they never have to engage in sexual activities that they are not comfortable with, or have to “prove” anything to their partner.

*   1.  **Why People Stay with Violent Partners**

Most survivors of intimate partner violence adopt strategies to maximize their safety and their children’s safety.

**What can appear to bystanders as inaction can be a strategy that protects the survivor and their children.**

Reasons that survivors stay with their violent partners include:

_- Fear of retaliation_

_- Lack of alternative means of economic support_

_- Concern for their children_

_- Lack of support from family and friends_

_- Stigma associated with divorce or living alone_

_- Fear of losing custody over their children_

_- Love and the hope that their partner will change_

**Despite these reasons, many survivors do leave their partners permanently. However, it may require multiple attempts over many years.**

Two main factors that contribute to a survivor’s decision to permanently leave their partners are a realization that their partner will not change and a recognition that the violence is affecting their children.

*   1.  **False Beliefs about Intimate Partner Violence**

**Many people in society have attitudes and beliefs about intimate partner violence that are false but are used to deny and justify intimate partner violence.**

The following examples of false beliefs focus on men as perpetrators of intimate partner violence and women as survivors. Although perpetrators and survivors can be from any gender, they are useful to examine as examples of false beliefs.

Some false beliefs about male intimate partner violence towards women include:

_- Men are superior to women and have a right to assert their power._

_- Men have a right to discipline women for their behavior._

_- Violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflict in a relationship._

_- In marriage, sexual intercourse is a man’s right._

_- Women should tolerate intimate partner violence to maintain the family unit._

_- Women deserve to be beaten._

_- Sexual activity, including rape, is a sign of masculinity._

_- Women are responsible for controlling men’s sexual desires._

*   1.  **Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence**

Intimate partner violence affects survivors in many ways, including injury and chronic health problems that come from prolonged stress.

**The more severe the abuse, the greater the impact on a survivor’s physical and mental health.**

_Injury and physical health_: This can include many types of injuries all over the body. In addition to injury, survivors can also experience illnesses that have no clear cause, often described as stress-related conditions. Survivors of intimate partner violence are twice as likely to report poor health and physical and mental health problems – even if the intimate partner violence occurred years before.

_Mental health and suicide_: Survivors of intimate partner violence have higher levels of depression, anxiety and fear than others and are more likely to experience emotional distress, thoughts of suicide and to attempt suicide.

In addition, intimate partner violence has also been linked to the following in survivors:

_- Alcohol and drug abuse_

_- Eating disorders_

_- Sleep disorders_

_- Physical inactivity_

_- Poor self-esteem_

_- Post-traumatic stress_

_- Smoking and other self-harming behavior_

_- Unsafe sexual behavior_

_Sexual and reproductive health_: Survivors of intimate partner violence may experience unintended and unwanted pregnancy, pregnancy complications, abortion and unsafe abortion, sexually-transmitted infections including HIV, urinary tract infections and sexual dysfunction.

_Violence during pregnancy_: Pregnancy is a significant risk factor for intimate partner violence and has been associated with:

_- Miscarriage_

_- Late entry into prenatal care_

_- Still birth_

_- Premature labor and birth_

_- Fetal injury_

_- Low birth-weight infants_

_Homicide and other mortality_: Research from a range of countries indicates that most female murder victims were killed by a partner, often in the context of intimate partner violence. Intimate partner violence also increases the risk of a survivor committing suicide.

_Effects on children_: Intimate partner violence has negative social and health consequences on children, including anxiety, depression, poor school performance and negative health outcomes. Children in households where there is intimate partner violence are also more likely to become either perpetrators or survivors later in life. Research also indicates that children in households with intimate partner violence have a greater likelihood of dying before the age of five.

*   1.  **Preventing and Responding to Intimate Partner Violence**

**Preventing and responding to intimate partner violence requires long-term, comprehensive collaboration between many parts of society, not just the individual perpetrator or survivor.**

The following strategies have demonstrated effectiveness:

_- Reforming civil and criminal frameworks_

_- Organizing media and advocacy campaigns to raise awareness about existing legislation_

_- Strengthening women’s civil rights related to divorce, property, child support and custody_

_- Building coalitions of government and civil society institutions_

_- Building the evidence base for advocacy and awareness_

_- Using behavior change communication to achieve social change_

_- Integrating a focus on intimate partner violence into sexual and reproductive health services_

_- Promoting the social and economic empowerment of women and girls_

_- Building comprehensive services to respond to intimate partner violence survivors in communities_

_- Engaging men and boys to promote non-violence and gender equality_

_- Providing early-intervention services to at-risk families_

_- Influencing knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of young people through life-skills programs such as classroom-based dating violence prevention programs_

1.  **Why We Need Advocates**

**Without advocates to speak up for survivors’ needs, the following situations are extremely common:**

_- A sexual assault survivor may come to the emergency department for care, but because their wounds are considered less serious than the critically ill or injured, they may have to wait for 4-12 hours in a busy public area without being allowed to eat, drink or urinate for fear of destroying evidence._

_- Healthcare providers may be insufficiently trained to do medical forensic exams and lack the ability to provide expert witness testimony in court._

_- Even if the survivor’s medical needs are met, their emotional needs are often ignored._

_- Healthcare providers may blame the survivor for the sexual assault, either explicitly or implicitly._

_- Healthcare providers may be reluctant to do a medical forensic exam because they are untrained in how to collect evidence, because they do not want to take the time away from other medically urgent patients, or because they do not want to testify in court. As a result, documentation of evidence may be rushed, inadequate or incomplete. Many doctors may even refuse to even do a medical forensic exam._

1.  **Crisis Intervention**

**Crisis reactions are how someone’s body and mind react to an event that is unusual and potentially dangerous or life-threatening, like sexual assault.**

The intensity of a crisis reaction depends on how a survivor perceives the experience, as well as many unique factors, including their age, ability to understand what has happened, and whether they have experienced crisis events in the past.

Most survivors feel that they are “in crisis” when they feel helpless and their normal coping strategies and techniques are overwhelmed.

**The crisis reaction is a completely normal response to an abnormal life event, like the crime of sexual assault.**

Although many survivors go through intense stages of emotion, many do not. It is important not to judge anyone’s reaction, as not all survivors will demonstrate strong emotions.

Crisis intervention techniques involve listening and focusing on the survivor’s reactions, assessing the survivor’s ability to cope and creating an action plan to help them cope.

1.  **What to Bring to the Health Center**

Different health centers may be prepared to support survivors needs – or not.

It is helpful for an advocate to arrive with the following:

_- Government-issued photo identification to identify yourself at the health center, and organization-specific identification if you are advocating as part of an organization’s services_

_- A list of emergency numbers, including law enforcement, child protection services and your organization’s support network (if you have one)_

_- A fully-charged mobile phone with ample credit topped up_

_- Two bottles of water: one for yourself and one for the survivor_

_- A snack or sandwich for the survivor (please be aware of any common dietary restrictions in your area)_

_- A set of modest clothes, including one-size-fits-most underwear and shoes for the survivor, who may need to leave their clothing as evidence_

_- A light blanket or shawl for the survivor, in case the health center is cold or they are in shock_

_- A coloring book with crayons and a few children’s books, in case the survivor needs to bring their children because they could not find child care_

_- An information packet of service referrals that are available for sexual assault survivors in your community_

1.  **LISTEN**

Listen to the survivor. Let them tell their story, vent and express their feelings.

1.  **Ethics of Confidentiality**

**It is important to discuss confidentiality at the beginning of your interactions with the survivor.**

This gives them the ability to determine what they want to disclose and how they want to proceed.

Confidentiality requirements allow survivors to reach out for support and know that their information is protected. Some countries have laws that require confidentiality for service providers working with survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence.

Survivors experience events that can cause trauma. Sharing their personal information without their consent can cause additional trauma.

**Sharing about sexual assault can also put the survivor’s life at risk.**

For example, survivors have committed suicide out of shame when photos identifying them as a survivor of assault were posted by the media. In many contexts, being the survivor of sexual assault can expose the survivor to further risk of assault by members of the community, including law enforcement.

It takes immense courage to tell a stranger about highly personal and traumatic experiences. As a service provider, having a confidential relationship with the survivor can help them explore how they want to access the healthcare system and potentially report the crime to the police.

**Having an advocate bound by confidentiality increases a survivor’s ability to access healthcare and law enforcement services.**

In many cases, without confidentiality, the survivor would not feel comfortable coming forward.

Confidentiality is the foundation of good advocacy and service provision for survivors. In areas where there is only one advocate or a limited number of healthcare providers, confidentiality is the only way that survivors may feel able to access the services they need.

**For an advocate to be able to claim confidentiality, they must be trained.**

For this reason, it can be important to create formal trainings in your community that supplement this training primer. For more information about how to access further training towards certification as a rape crisis counselor, see the “Additional Training” in the Resources section.

The following sections will explore important aspects of confidentiality and the ethics of being an advocate. This is essential material to understand thoroughly.

*   1.  **Privacy, Confidentiality and Privilege**

Privacy, confidentiality and privilege have different meanings and as an advocate, you must know and understand these differences to be able to effectively advocate for the survivor.

**Privacy is a survivor’s right to control their story and personal information.**

For some survivors, maintaining their privacy may directly reduce their changes of experiencing assault again. If the survivor’s information is not kept private, the perpetrator may be able to find the survivor and to perpetrate another crime against them.

**Confidentiality refers to the rules that prohibit service providers from disclosing survivor information.**

Many service providers, including advocates, are bound by the rules of confidentiality.

Often, local or national laws, regulations, donor or grant conditions, agency or organization policies or codes of ethics will include confidentiality rules.

These rules:

_- Limit the disclosure of any information about the survivor by community-based service providers without the survivor’s informed, written and time-limited consent._

_- Require that service providers disclose any limits to confidentiality during their initial meeting with the survivor._

**Privilege is different from confidentiality. It applies to communications between the survivor and certain professions, as defined by law.**

These professions include physicians, psychologists and clinical social workers. In some countries and contexts, crisis counselors for sexual assault survivors and intimate partner violence survivors are included, but this is not always the case.

Keep in mind that communication is not considered privileged if it is overheard by a third party. If you work in an area where you are not covered by such a law, you must be very careful in your discussions with the survivor because if you are present when they are in a privileged conversation (for example, with a lawyer), then your presence as a third person could invalidate that privilege.

**There are exceptions to confidentiality.**

If you are advocating for a survivor of child or elder abuse, your country will likely have mandatory reporting laws that compel you to report the case to an authority.

*   1.  **Personally-Identifying Information**

Advocates must understand how and why to maintain records and communications that do not include personally-identifying information that could be used to identify the survivor.

**Personally-identifying information is any information that could be used to identify an individual, including information that could be used to determine a survivor’s location.**

Even if this information is encrypted or otherwise protected, it is still considered personally-identifying information.

This can include, but is not limited to, the survivor’s:

_- First and last names_

_- Any personal information that would help to identify an individual, including their date of birth, race or ethnicity, religion or physical characteristics_

_- Home, work, school or other physical address_

_- Contact information, including email address, postal address, Internet protocol address or telephone number_

_- Government document number, including passport, driver’s license or social security card_

_- Any other identification number, including student or work identification number_

**What qualifies as personally-identifying information depends on the circumstances.**

For example, in a small area, information such as how many children the survivor has or what race or ethnicity they are could be enough to identify them.

*   1.  **Consequences of Confidentiality Breaches**

**Confidentiality breaches are very serious and damaging. They can create dangerous situations for you as an advocate and for the survivor.**

If a confidentiality breach happens, survivors and service providers can lose trust in you and, if you are volunteering as part of the organization, the reputation of your organization can suffer.

**Confidentiality breaches can expose the survivor to risk of further violence and may even risk their life.**

When confidentiality breaches happen, the risk of retaliation by a perpetrator increases. If information about them becomes public without their consent, the survivor’s reputation can be damaged which may even threaten their life.

For these reasons, confidentiality is critical to respect the survivor’s privacy and to help ensure their safety and the safety of service providers.

**It is essential to discuss confidentiality at the beginning of your interaction with the survivor.**

You will need to explain:

_- Your role as an advocate_

_- The survivor’s right to privacy_

_- Confidentiality as it applies to your role as an advocate_

_- How the survivor’s information may be disclosed_

_- Privilege as it applies to the survivor and the service providers they will encounter. For example, physicians are bound by privilege but you, as an advocate, may not be. For this reason, it is essential to understand privilege in your country’s context._

_- Any mandated reporting laws that exist in your country. Again, it is essential to understand and disclose these in the beginning of your role as an advocate._

*   1.  **Confidentiality and Victim Blaming**

Many countries now have laws that protect the confidentiality of what survivors share with advocates.

Even in places where an advocate’s confidentiality is not yet legally protected, courts often rule that because counseling the client is so valuable for the role it plays in helping the survivor to feel safe, the benefit of confidentiality outweighs the need for the court to know every bit of information about the assault.

**Confidentiality has helped to prevent victim blaming within the court system, which is when the survivor is held responsible for the crime that was committed against them.**

One example of victim blaming that can happen during a court case is if information is shared that the survivor was drinking, wearing a certain type of clothing, or invited the perpetrator to their home.

Rather than holding the perpetrator accountable for the crime that they committed, the assumption of society and the court can be to blame the survivor for what happened.

For this reason, confidentiality and the survivor’s right to privacy protect them. An advocate or service provider’s assertion of privilege can prevent the disclosure of confidential information.

*   1.  **Safely Disclosing Information with Releases and Waivers**

**Unless you are legally mandated to report the survivor’s situation to authorities, you should never share personally-identifying information or information that the survivor shares with you without a signed release or waiver from the survivor.**

Advocates and their organizations must protect the confidentiality and privacy of the survivors they serve. This includes the safety of adult, youth and child survivors of domestic violence, intimate partner violence, sexual assault or stalking and includes the survivors’ families.

Regardless of whether the information has been protected, advocates and their organizations must not disclose, reveal or release any personally-identifying information or individual information collected about the services they provide without a release or waiver.

**It is always the survivor’s decision to sign a release or waiver.**

In the release or waiver, the survivor’s consent must be:

_- Informed_

_- Written_

_- Reasonably time-limited_

It is essential to provide the survivor with complete and accurate information about releases and waivers so that they can make a well-informed decision in their best interests.

Information cannot be released if the perpetrator, who may be the survivor’s partner or guardian, signs the release form on the survivor’s behalf.

*   1.  **Self-Harm and Suicidal Tendencies**

**Sexual assault can be extremely traumatic and overwhelming, and some survivors may become suicidal.**

If a survivor directly or indirectly mentions that they are thinking of self-harm or suicide, or if you believe this is a possibility based on your interactions with them, ask the survivor directly if they are thinking about self-harm.

At the same time, you will need to disclose to the survivor that you have a mandated duty to report self-harm or suicidal tendencies to the health center if they disclose this to you.

Do not be afraid to do this.

**People do not get the idea to self-harm or chose to self-harm simply because it is mentioned to them.**

Information about self-harm or other potentially harmful coping mechanisms can be used in court to discredit the survivor. It is crucial that your notes or other record-keeping prioritize the survivor’s need for privacy.

If you have reason to believe that the survivor may be a danger to themselves or others, you have an obligation to report this to the health center.

*   *   1.  **Evaluating the Risk of Suicide**

The following questionnaire can help you to determine the risk of suicide behavior in a survivor.

Responses can be used to identify if a survivor is at-risk of suicide and help to highlight specific risk behaviors:

_Question A_: Looks at lifetime suicide ideation and/or suicide attempts

_Question B_: Looks at the frequency of suicidal ideation over the past 12 months

_Question C_: Looks at the threat of suicide attempt

_Question D_: Looks at self-reported likelihood of suicidal behavior in the future

**Ask the survivor to select one answer for each question and make note of their answer.**

_A. Have you ever thought about or attempted to kill yourself?_

1\. Never

2\. It was just a brief passing thought

3a. I have had a plan at least once to kill myself but I did not try to do it

3b. I have had a plan at least once to kill myself and really wanted to die

4a. I have attempted to kill myself, but did not want to die

4b. I have attempted to kill myself and really wanted to die

_B. How often have you thought about killing yourself in the past year?_

1\. Never

2\. Rarely (1 time)

3\. Sometimes (2 times)

4\. Often (3-4 times)

5\. Very often (5 or more times)

_C. Have you ever told someone that you were going to commit suicide or that you might do it?_

1\. No

2a. Yes, at one time, but did not really want to die

2b. Yes, at one time, and really wanted to die

3a. Yes, more than once, but did not want to do it

3b. Yes, more than once, and really wanted to do it

_D. How like is it that you will attempt suicide someday?_

0\. Never

1\. No chance at all

2\. Rather unlikely

3\. Unlikely

4\. Likely

5\. Rather likely

6.Very likely

Add up the number of points next to each answer that the survivor selected.

Based on the severity of the response, you may need to share this information with the health center.

1.  **Introducing Yourself to the Survivor**

The survivors you support have placed you in a position of trust.

**Respect that trust by being a thoughtful listener and by never judging the survivors or any disclosures they may make.**

An advocate uses good communication skills, both verbal and non-verbal, to help the survivor feel more comfortable with their role and their presence.

It is likely that the survivor has not had an advocate before and may be unsure or hesitant to accept help.

**Before you consider yourself empowered to serve as an advocate for a survivor, they must understand and consent to your role.**

It is never appropriate to advocate for someone without their consent. If they are unfit to give consent or are under the age where they can legally give consent, and there is no family member or guardian present to give consent, then the health center itself can give consent.

**Try to give back a sense of trust and control.**

Remember that over 85% of sexual assault perpetrators are known to the survivor (for example, a family member, acquaintance or friend), and the survivor’s sense of trust and control has been violated.

Through your actions as an advocate, do your best to give the survivor a sense of trust in you and control over the situations around them.

You can help to create a sense of control by asking permission before sitting down or taking other actions, for example asking if it is alright to ask the survivor questions.

**Sexual assault survivors have had their consent violated and an important part of their recovery is to regain the power of their consent.**

At every opportunity, ask permission from the survivor. For example, a good way to begin is to approach the survivor while keeping a respectful physical distance and to ask, “May I sit down?”

If you do not already know the survivor and you have been called to serve as an advocate by the health center or other organization, introduce yourself to the advocate.

In your own words, cover these essential roles of an advocate:

_* A volunteer_

_* Bound by confidentiality_

_* Present to advocate for survivors’ needs at the health center and for no other reason_

If the survivor has pain, bleeding, nausea, difficulty breathing, or if they feel unsafe in the health center, notify a healthcare provider immediately.

*   1.  **Active Listening: Part 1**

**Advocates must have excellent listening skills, as listening is far more effective than talking for building trust and finding out what the survivor needs.**

For an advocate, the skill of active listening is essential if you are to successfully connect with and support the survivor.

We often think of listening as passive, but when we listen we construct meaning from both verbal and nonverbal messages.

**Active listening requires that you fully concentrate, understand, respond and remember what the survivor is saying.**

You must also communicate to the survivor that you are listening, so that they feel heard. Providing appropriate feedback can help the survivor to feel more at ease communicating with you.

You can do this verbally and non-verbally the following ways. However, please keep in mind that active listening is done differently across different cultures, so not suggestions may be appropriate for your context:

* _Nod your head_: When the survivor is speaking, this can be a powerful way to affirm that they are being listened to and understood.

* _Be aware of your posture_: An active listener conveys that they are listening through their body language and usually tends to lean slightly forward or to the side when sitting. Active listeners tend to have their head at a slight angle or rest their head on one hand.

* _Pay attention with your body language_: Do your best not to fidget, play with your hair or fingernails, look at your watch or a clock, or do any other action that could be interpreted by the survivor as inattentive. It helps to create self-awareness around what you do when you are distracted. Learn to control these non-verbal cues to increase your focus, attention and ability to be present.

* _Verbal active listening_: You could say “Mmm hmm” at certain points when the survivor is speaking, to show that you are listening and encourage them to continue. However, gauge the reaction of the survivor to this technique, as it can feel like interrupting if overused or used in the wrong context.

* _Remember the details_: You will get distracted, especially by things happening in the health center environment, but it is essential that you do your best to remember important details that the survivor shares. This will build trust and show the survivor that you are listening.

* _Use eye contact sparingly_: While it can be encouraging for the listener to look at the speaker, it can also be intimidating, so use this technique carefully. Use your own best judgement to determine how much eye contact is appropriate for the situation and when. When you do use eye contact, combine it with other non-verbal techniques to encourage the survivor to speak.

Active listening also involves patience during natural pauses and periods of silence. You may be tempted to jump in with questions or comments when these occur, but do not. Instead, give the survivor the time and space they need to explore their thoughts and feelings.

**Before you decide to speak, think of the acronym WAIT: Why Am I Talking?**

**Most of the time, you should be listening.**

In general, it is best not to repeat back, or paraphrase, the survivor’s words. Although some words of encouragement may be beneficial, paraphrasing tends to take the focus away from what the survivor is saying, as they may be tempted to correct or further clarify their message for you.

Adjust your active listening by paying close attention to the survivor’s verbal and body language cues, to see if you need to decrease or increase your level of feedback.

*   1.  **Active Listening: Part 2**

Once you understand the basics of active listening, the following skills can be layered on to further enhance your ability to support the survivor.

Each of these skills require the advocate to have emotional awareness about when it is culturally and contextually appropriate to use them.

Advocates often make mistakes and no advocate is perfect, so do your best to do no harm and support the advocate in a way that is present and authentic to you.

- _Expressing empathy_: Survivors of sexual assault are crime victims, and it is important for advocates to recognize that they may be having feelings that they do not normally experience. Acceptance is the foundation of empathy and happens when the advocate acknowledges the survivor’s feelings, situation and perspectives without any judgement, criticism or blame. Acceptance doesn’t mean agreement or approval, it simply means that you acknowledge what the survivor is sharing, especially when they are feeling strong emotions. Avoid summarizing what the survivor is sharing, and instead simply acknowledge the emotions they are feeling.

**Never tell a survivor that you understand how they feel – you do not. Every survivor is different.**

- _Asking questions_: Use your best judgement when asking questions, as questions should be only in service to the survivor and never to indulge your own sense of curiosity. Keep questions open-ended (so that they cannot be answered with a yes or no answer), as this encourages the survivor to speak rather than feeling interrogated.

- _Paraphrasing_: Reflecting back to the survivor what they have said can show them that you are paying attention and that you are staying present with them. Use your best judgement for paraphrasing may be appropriate. When you are finished, ask the survivor if you understood them correctly and give them a chance to clarify.

- _Affirming the survivor’s experience_: Affirmations such as “You are strong,” and “You will get through this,” recognize a survivor’s strengths and can help build their confidence in their own resilience. However, you need to fully mean your affirmation and express it in a way that is appropriate to the survivor and their situation, or you risk alienating them and making them feel further isolated and alone.

*   1.  **Building Assertiveness**

As an advocate, you are present with the survivor at the health center so that they can receive the quality services they need. If you are passive in attempting to obtain those services, you will not get what you want to meet the survivors’ needs. However, if you are aggressive, you may anger those who have the resources the survivor needs. When advocating for a survivor’s needs, assertiveness is the best option.

Your cultural context will determine how each of these traits are expressed in your community and in the health center.

**Building Assertiveness**

As an advocate, sometimes you may have difficulty obtaining services for a survivor or persuading someone to help. If you learn to be assertive, you can often get what you want and still maintain good relationships.

- _Be prepared_: Make sure you know what you want to say, why you want to say it, and how you want to say it. You may run into potential obstacles or resistance, so think in advance about how you might handle any challenges that may arise.

- _Body language_: If you are speaking to someone in person, stand or sit straight but relaxed. Even when speaking on the phone, this posture can help you feel more confident. Face the person you are speaking to with a pleasant but serious facial expression. Keep your voice calm and soft and your eyes focused on the other person.

- _Use “I” statements:_ “I” statements are direct and not accusatory, like “you” statements can be. Keep the focus on the challenge you are facing, rather than on the other person. For example, try “I would like to be able to tell you what the survivor needs,” instead of, “You are not listening to what I am saying.”

- _Know the facts and use them to support your case_. Avoid judgments or accusations. The person you are speaking with can argue with judgments and accusations, but they cannot argue with facts. For example, say, “An hour ago, you told me the survivor would be eligible for free antiretroviral medication,” instead of, “Why did you tell me the survivor was eligible for free antiretroviral medication when you know that was not the case?”

- _Focus on the survivor’s needs_: Make sure that you focus on the solution and what the survivor needs. This will help you earn the trust of the other person. Be calm and open, not angry, aggressive, or abrasive.

- _Speak with confidence:_ In communicating your message, speak clearly, firmly, and loud enough to be easily heard. Use fewer words for more effect, and don’t apologize or make excuses for your position. Support yourself and what you are seeking to accomplish. Project confidence in your role as an advocate.

- _Listen:_ Listen carefully to what the other person is saying to you. Listening carefully will be critical in preparing your response. Answer questions and clarify information when asked. Make clear, direct requests. Do not invite the person to say “no.”

- _Do not back down:_ Stand firm for the survivor’s needs. Negotiate a compromise rather than give in completely. Remember, stick to your goal, and do not allow yourself to become distracted by other issues.

*   1.  **Personal Boundaries**

As an advocate, boundaries between you and the survivor are important to maintaining a supportive and healthy relationship for you both.

Because the survivor may discuss extremely intimate details with you, you will need to maintain personal boundaries to create a safe space for the survivor to share.

**The boundary between the advocate and the survivor needs to stay extremely clear.**

It is important that the advocate not cross this boundary. This can be challenging if the advocate starts to identify with the survivor’s story.

**If you begin to identify with the survivor’s story, it is important not to express these feelings to the survivor.**

Keep these feelings to yourself and be mindful of personal boundaries. Later, for your own self-care, discuss these feelings later with a counselor, another advocate or a trusted friend.

**Advocacy is about empowering the survivor to make good choices for themselves, not about you as an advocate.**

The advocate can help the survivor to examine their options and navigate the pros and cons of certain actions, but it is up to the survivor to make the choices that are best for themselves, their life and their family.

It is essential that the survivor not try to please the advocate, the health center staff or law enforcement when making decisions. The survivor does not need to please anyone but themselves.

Creating and maintaining personal boundaries support the survivor as they develop trust and vulnerability in their relationship with the advocate.

**As advocates, we need to be aware of warning signs that a survivor is crossing a boundary into what could be an unhealthy relationship with us.**

We must avoid putting ourselves in potentially risky situations or creating potentially unsafe or risky situations for the survivor.

**For this reason, it is important to independently address our own personal issues and not bring them into our advocacy for survivors.**

Advocates often have a personal history as survivors of sexual assault, intimate partner violence or another trauma in their past.

**While this can be part of why you want to volunteer, it is important that you create and maintain strong boundaries so that you do not over-identify with the survivor.**

There will be times when a survivor’s story may trigger your own trauma to come to the surface. If this happens, it is important that you are aware of how to create and maintain strong personal boundaries. Otherwise, you could end up relating to the survivor around your own trauma, rather than your role to help and support the survivor with their needs.

*   *   1.  **Examples of Crossing Boundaries**

We need to recognize warning signs when a relationship is becoming unhealthy. This takes self-awareness, as these warning signs show up in ourselves and others.

Here are some common examples how you could cross a survivor’s personal boundaries with your advocacy:

_- Telling them that in their situation you would feel a certain way, for example, angry or upset_

_- Mirroring the survivor’s feelings, for example getting angry when the get angry or upset when they get upset_

_- Over-identifying with the survivor_

_- Feeling angry or upset at the survivor_

_- Feeling manipulated by the survivor_

_- Feeling resentful of the survivor_

_- Feeling judgmental of the survivor’s decisions_

_- Blaming the survivor_

_- Wanting to punish or attack the survivor_

_- Yelling or raising your voice at the survivor_

_- Making a choice for the survivor_

_- Sharing personal details of your life_

_- Changing the focus from the survivor to yourself_

_- Trying to be friends with the survivor_

_- Feeling like no one can help the survivor like you can_

_- Creating an environment where the survivor is dependent on you_

_- Feeling sexually attracted to the survivor_

_- Feeling sexually aroused in response to the survivor’s description of sexual assault_

_- Pressuring the survivor to share personal contact or other information with you_

_- Sharing your personal contact details instead of the general information for how to contact an advocate_

One example of crossing boundaries is wanting to give out your personal contact details. You may think in the moment that you are the only person who can help the survivor, and that you could support them better if they could contact you directly, rather than contacting your network of advocates or your organization, but this is simply not true.

Another example of crossing boundaries would be to plan to see the survivor outside of your position as a crisis advocate. It is essential to keep your relationship as an advocate clear and you cannot do this if you try to create another type of relationship with the survivor. For this reason, it is important to refer the survivor to other service providers in your network and to guard that the relationship does not overstep these boundaries.

*   *   1.  **Alternatives to Crossing Boundaries**

Sometimes, we forget our role as an advocate and need to redraw these boundaries again.

Here are some things that you can say to the survivor to maintain good boundaries:

_- “You sound angry.”_

_- “You sound upset.”_

_- “You made the best decision you could in the moment.”_

_- “This is not about me; it is about empowering you to make the best decisions for yourself right now.”_

_- “You are the one who can make the best decisions for yourself right now.”_

_- “I am here to help and support you as you figure out the best way forward.”_

_- “I understand that it can be scary to make a choice. You are the only one who can do this.”_

_- “I am here to listen, help and support.”_

_- “That is a really difficult situation to be in. I know because I have been in difficult situations.”_

Remember, you are not a therapist or a counselor; your role is to listen to and support the survivor through a crisis situation, not to help them with decades of problems and issues.

The survivor may attach to you, so you to need to draw boundaries. For example, if they insist that you are on the only person who understands their situation, you may need to remind them that there are many qualified service providers who can help and support them.

After supporting a survivor, it is normal to think back and wonder if you helped them to the best of your ability. You may want to follow up with them, but do not reach out.

**Allow them to make the decision about whether to reach out.**

Especially if the case has been difficult, it can be helpful to talk things over with your organization, other advocates or a counselor without breaking confidentiality.

**If you feel overwhelmed by supporting a survivor, it is even more important to seek help.**

Giving yourself professional psychological support for your work will help you to continue volunteering. Recognize your own limits, your stress levels and how you are trigged. If an unresolved issue from your own experiences surfaces, professional psychological support enables you to address it in a healthy and appropriate way.

**Remember why you wanted to be an advocate in the first place and make a commitment to taking care of yourself so your work thrives.**

You should only volunteer when you are able to maintain strong personal boundaries.

A stressful life situation can make volunteering difficult. When this is the case, it is always acceptable to take a break. The “Self-Care and Resiliency” section has more information about how to care for yourself.

*   1.  **Communicating by Phone and Email**

Supporting a survivor in-person is not always possible. It may be necessary to communicate by phone or electronically, which could include text messaging or email.

**It is extremely important to be sure that that the communication is safe, especially when communicating with survivors of intimate partner violence.**

Always ask the survivor, when they are not accompanied by the perpetrator, how to communicate with them safely and follow their lead.

_Arranging to Meet at the Health Center:_ As an advocate, a survivor may contact you by phone or electronically asking you to meet them at the health center. For the purposes of evidence collection, is important that you tell them not to use the toilet, eat or drink until they have been seen by a healthcare provider at the health center.

You may plan to meet them personally or to have someone from your network of advocates meet them, depending on the situation.

_Communicating by Phone:_ Phone communication or video messaging involves the same advocacy skills as face-to-face communication, with the following additional suggestions:

_- Be sure that you have adequate phone credit and a strong phone signal, so you do not get disconnected._

_- Find someplace quiet to talk from and try to keep background noise to a minimum._

_- Before you begin, ask if the time of the call is convenient for the survivor and make other arrangements if needed._

_- Match your tone of voice to what you are communicating. For example, if you are expressing empathy, keep your voice soft and speak slowly. Tone of voice is especially important because you do not have the benefit of visual cues to reinforce your message._

_- Take notes on your main points before the call, so that you do not forget critical information you need to communicate._

_- Reassure survivors that you are listening by using phrases such as “I see,” so that they know you are giving them your full attention._

_- Use the same professionalism you would in an in-person encounter._

**Communicating Electronically**

It might be necessary to communicate with a survivor online, to exchange information clearly or to arrange to accompany them to seek medical care.

It is much easier for a survivor to misinterpret a message received by text or email than it would be face-to-face, because there are no non-verbal signals to help convey meaning.

*   1.  **Basic Helpline Skills (The ABC Method)**

If your organization offers a helpline for survivors of sexual assault to get referrals, support and help, you can use this model to help you learn the skills to take helpline calls.

The ABC Method is a useful way to remember how to structure your interactions.

These same skills can be helpful for in-person advocates supporting survivors in healthcare centers.

*   *   1.  **A: Achieving Contact**

Say hello, introduce yourself and explain your role. Ask the survivor how you can best serve them.

Try to help them feel comfortable in starting the process of talking because it may be very difficult. Just because they contacted you doesn’t mean they’re ready to share, so you need to create a sense of safety for them. Let the survivor know you are listening and that you are there.

**The first concern is always the physical safety of the caller.**

If there are disturbing background noises or the person is in a physical state of alarm, address their physical safety first before you asses whatever else is going on, until it’s clear that the caller is not in physical danger or in need of emergency aid.

Background noise like television or children may also indicate that there is a lot happening around the person and that may impact their ability to talk about difficult issues, as well as your ability to understand what the caller is saying.

**It is important that the caller feels safe.**

If they sound anxious or upset, and they start talking about what has happened, it may make them more nervous or they may start to cry. Their tone of voice may rise or they may speak faster.

You may need to help calm them down and perhaps tell them to pause for a minute, and not worry yet about telling you what’s happened. You might suggest they take some deep breaths with you, to help calm you both and to relax.

If they need a moment to gather themselves, that is okay.

If the person starts to whisper or hangs up on you, it may mean they no longer have privacy. You do not want them to feel like because they called, now you are going to force them to talk about something that may not be appropriate right now.

Confidentiality helps to create a sense of trust and safety for the caller, so we want to ensure that confidentiality is respected.

This means that if the survivor tells you something, you need to keep it confidential. Mandated reporting means that you must report it to an authority, depending on the laws in your area, and it mostly relates to suicidal tendencies or child abuse.

Because you are only hearing verbal cues, practicing active listening becomes even more important to show that you’re paying attention.

If you notice yourself getting distracted during the call, sit up or move locations so that you can focus completely on what the caller is saying. Holding a listening posture, even though the caller cannot see you, will help with this. So will giving verbal cues, like saying “I hear you,” or “I see.”

**Pay attention to what is not being said and to the tone of voice of the caller.**

We need to listen for what’s really going on and be open to subtle cues.

It is also helpful to validate the caller’s feelings and to assure them that calling was a good idea. Listening in this way helps the caller to identify emotions and encourage them to talk about something they may not have shared before. In addition, help the caller to feel like they are in control of the call.

Remember that the conversation is about helping the caller, not you. You may experience strong emotion during the call and while that is okay, it is not appropriate for you to communicate them in any way to the caller.

**Avoid making judgements about the caller, who may be doing things that you do not understand.**

The call is about them and getting them the help and support that they need.

Often, callers’ stories will be difficult to understand, especially around the sequence of events. The caller may also try to give you excessive detail to try to help you understand what happened.

**Let the caller tell their story without jumping to conclusions and accompany them on their journey through this process.**

If the caller tells you something you find hard to believe, because that is not your experience of the world, remember that everyone is different and validate their experience.

It can be frustrating to feel like the caller is rambling or telling a very long story, but do not lose focus as you never know when the caller will share something of key importance.

While we want to support the caller and offer referrals and help, we do not want to get so caught up in sharing information that we lose our connection with the caller.

**Avoid thinking you can fix the situation, that you know more than the caller does, or that you have all the answers, all of which can make the caller feel inferior and wonder why they called.**

Fear can impact our ability to listen, because we are afraid of saying the wrong thing.

If you have these fears, it is important to talk to someone about them and to make sure that offering this kind of support is something that you really want to do. Then, it is important to put these feelings aside and to be completely present for the caller.

*   *   1.  **B: Focusing on the Issue**

Sometimes, a caller with a long history of abuse and sexual assault will call a helpline and it will be the first time someone is really listening to them, supporting them and believing them. They may start to use the helpline as an opportunity to unload, and you will need to use your communication skills to help identify what it is they need at that moment.

**You will need good communication skills to clarify that you have correctly understood what the caller is saying and that you have their story correct.**

_Paraphrasing_: Repeating the caller’s message is a key communication skill and involves repeating what the caller said in similar, but fewer, words. Do this anytime a caller tells you a long story, to get to the root of what is going on and to test your current understanding of the content so far.

If your paraphrasing is correct, it encourages the caller to continue because they know that they have been heard and understood, which creates trust and rapport.

_Clarifying:_ This is another important communication skill to use, because you will not always understand the message the caller is trying to convey, especially if their timeline jumps around a lot. It is always better to ask a clarifying question than to assume you understand something.

Otherwise, when you paraphrase what you thought you heard, the caller may become upset because you did not hear them correctly, which breaks trust and rapport and does not give them what they need.

**Clarifying gives the caller control as they have an opportunity to agree or to correct your understanding of the situation.**

_Reflecting:_ Reflecting back to the person what you are hearing can be useful to help identify feelings. Rather than asking questions, we can reflect feelings back as the caller is talking about something that happened.

For example, we might say, “I might feel angry if that happened to me,” to start to name feelings for somebody, especially if they are feeling numb and disconnected from their feelings.

**Reflecting lets the caller know that you are listening and empathizing with their feelings.**

_Pick and choose how you ask questions_: It is not necessary for you to know every piece of information; be sure not to ask questions just to satisfy your curiosity. Avoid asking “why” questions, because they tend to be accusatory.

Rather than blaming the survivor, blame the perpetrator who violated boundaries and committed the sexual assault. Asking questions like “Can you tell me more about how that made you feel?” or “What do you think that means?” can help lead a quiet caller into a conversation.

Remember, this is a difficult topic for people to discuss and they may feel wary and uncomfortable about what they are saying, so we want to make them feel more comfortable. For example, “I would be angry,” or, “It is understandable that you feel angry. Many people would feel angry in that situation.”

Questions can also help if the caller starts to lose focus on what they were saying. Picking a single theme and selecting one word or phrase to repeat back as a question can be helpful to bring them back to what is happening now and why they called.

The easiest way to do this is to ask, “What made you call the helpline today?”

The helpline is there to support people dealing with sexual assault, not to help them deal with decades of issues in a 20-minute helpline call.

**It is important to focus the caller because sometimes receiving help and support can feel like counseling, and the helpline is not counseling.**

Our role as an advocate is to find the one thing that we can talk about to handle the crisis in the moment, and to hopefully refer the caller to someone who can provide longer-term support, if that is available in your community.

Once we have heard what the caller says and we have helped them to figure out some of their feelings, we have a better understanding of why the person has called and what they need.

**Although the caller may feel helpless and hopeless, it is important to help them realize that they have the solutions that they need.**

They are in control because this is their issue and you cannot fix it for them. You are there to support, provide resources if necessary, and empower them to find a solution.

You may have callers who do not want to end the call because they need more help and support than the helpline can offer. They may be scared and afraid of trying solutions on their own, but in realize they’re the only ones who can take control of the situation.

Once they chose a solution that works best for them, you may need to restate the problem and summarize the different solutions. For example, you could say, “We have talked about what is going on and how you feel, and we have come up with several plans. Here are the things you have agreed to try.”

We want to make sure that the caller creates a Safety Plan (more about this in the section “How to Safety Plan”), because once the call ends, that plan is going to help them know what to do next.

Asking, for example, “How do things look to you now?” is one way to see if things look more hopeful and safer than they did at the beginning of the call. This does not mean that everything is fixed, but it does help the caller reflect that together you have created a plan to deal with what is going on right now, so that when the call ends they can take control of the situation.

If you have someone who remains unwilling to get off the call, you can say “Now I am going to let you go. You can try the things we planned and if you are having a difficult time, you can always call us back. Thank you for calling.”

Rather than being rude or mean, what we’re saying is that the caller has the solutions and needs to have the strength to move forward and try them out.

*   *   1.  **C: Coping with Problems**

Sometimes, a fake caller will contact the helpline. If the caller is harassing you on the helpline, tell the person that their number can be traced and hang up. One way to bypass this is to play an automated message as an initial helpline greeting, if that is possible with your phone line.

Many callers will also feel scared the first time they call, and although they may have thought they were ready to talk, they may hang up the phone.

**Remember that they are having a tough time, that this is not about you, and do not take it personally.**

If the person is not speaking on the other line, you may hear they are crying and it may take them a minute to speak, or they may never talk.

In these situations, you need to keep saying things to help achieve contact. Give them the benefit of the doubt and ask if you can help them. Especially if someone is crying, say something to calm them, for example, “I am going to take a couple of deep breaths to help calm myself, if you would like to join me.”

They may start talking or they may not feel comfortable enough to talk. If after that, they decide not to communicate, you cannot be helpful to them and you need to keep the line open for someone else who may be trying to call in.

After you’ve tried to establish trust and safety, you may need to say, for example, “We are always here to talk, so when you are ready, I would be happy to have you call back. Right now I have to let you go, though. Thank you for calling.”

Sometimes, you may get a phone call from somebody calling the helpline who is angry that a family member has received advocacy services and who screams into the phone, maybe using aggressive language.

Try not to let them know that you are upset, as that is what are hoping to do: do not give them the satisfaction. Keep your voice disinterested, take a deep breath and remember, it is not about you. They are just targeting their anger about what is going on at you, because you are available.

You could say, for example, “I am sorry you feel that way, but I cannot talk to you while you are screaming. I am hanging up now,” and then end the call.

**You do not have to keep them on the phone hoping their attitude will change; that is not what the helpline is for.**

If you suspect that a caller has mental health issues, or if the caller’s focus suddenly changes to you, for example asking about sexual or personal details, and you are sure that the person is not a survivor, consider ending the call.

Taking inappropriate phone calls is not the job of helpline volunteers. You are there to help people in need who are in a crisis around sexual assault.

If you have a resistant or chronic caller several times in the same evening, make sure to note the number they are calling from and if they have already received services from your helpline.

Stay focused on small steps and problem resolution by focusing the caller on what made them call right now, and addressing that one problem or one issue that they are having, rather them allowing them to ramble.

**It is okay to end the call firmly but gently.**

Be firm about summarizing what you’ve discussed, how they are feeling and then safety plan moving forward with them so that they can act to solve things on their own.

**Whenever you end a call, no matter how frustrated, upset or angry you might be with the caller, you must do so politely and respectfully.**

You may have a lot of feelings when you get off the phone, and these are normal reactions to have, but it is important to not react from your feelings when you are on the phone with the caller.

It is not about your feelings, it is about listening to help the caller figure out what the plan is moving forward, and giving them the support and validation that they need.

If you need to talk to someone about your feelings regarding a call, that is okay, but you must not do that with the caller themselves. We always want to make sure that we are being polite, respectful, helpful and supportive to everybody that calls the helpline.

1.  **Culture, Diversity and Inclusion**

**Culture plays an important part in how we show up as advocates and in how the health center treats sexual assault survivors.**

It can be helpful to think of culture as a filter through which people process their experiences. Culture influences values, actions and self-expectations, and impacts perceptions and expectations of others.

Many of us identify with more than one cultural group. For example, some people may place more emphasis on their ancestry while other may place more emphasis on their sexual orientation or gender role.

Even within the same culture, some characteristics will be more important to one person than to another, and the differences between two individuals may be more pronounced than their similarities.

**Diversity is defined as differences to culture, background and experience among individuals and groups.**

**Inclusion is defined as the programs and strategies that embrace each person’s diversity.**

Both diversity and inclusion occur in a safe, positive and nurturing environment — going beyond simply tolerating difference, and towards celebrating it.

**Barriers to diversity and inclusion can be caused by “cultural collisions.”**

This is when groups with different cultural characteristics (for example, traditions, values, world views or languages) come together and neither group can view the situation from the perspective of the other.

So that you can help to avoid “cultural collisions,” it is important to understand how cultural factors influence survivors’ interactions with you and the services providers at the health center.

*   1.  **Cultural Competency**

**Cultural expectations, norms and traditions may interfere with effective communication between the survivor, the healthcare providers and you as an advocate.**

To navigate this, learn how to practice cultural competency so that you can understand our own cultural values, respect the survivor’s cultural values and accept the differences between them.

Cultural competency is also necessary in the health center context, where cultural attitudes may become barriers to healthcare providers offering an appropriate set of services to survivors of sexual assault.

For example, cultural attitudes influence:

- What it means to be a survivor of sexual assault;

- How emotion is expressed and shared;

- The role of the family in supporting the survivor;

- If and how a survivor seeks help

- Whether or not a survivor shares private matters with strangers;

- The understanding of cause and effect in sexual assault;

- Expectations of how the survivors acts and feels;

- What type of help or services the survivor or the health providers believe are necessary;

- Expectations about recovery, empowerment, retribution and revenge.

- What a survivor expects from you as an advocate and how you respond to the survivor.

Once you accept cultural differences, you can begin to understand the cultural dynamics and how they affect your interactions. Then, you can adapt practical skills to fit the cultural context of the survivor and the health center.

Cultural competency also involves recognizing the imbalance of power and issues of oppression and privilege, although these issues are not ones we will cover here.

Although we are using “cultural competency,” some organizations prefer the terms “cultural accountability” or “cultural responsiveness” instead, on the assumption that a person can never be “competent” in a culture that is not their own.

*   1.  **Cultural Communication Styles**

Culture determines the tone of voice we use, topics that are considered appropriate or inappropriate, how far we stand from the person we are communicating with, and the like.

**For diverse survivors to be understood and supported, advocates must have knowledge of and sensitivity to different cultural communication styles.**

Different communication styles can result in negative judgements about another person and ultimately make a message very difficult to hear.

**Because most communication is nonverbal, understanding nonverbal signals when communicating across different cultures is especially important.**

Nonverbal cues mean different things in different cultures, so as advocates, we need to be cautious of the interpretations we attach to these behaviors.

Communication styles can result in negative judgments about another person. This can lead to blocked communication shutdown that ultimately results in a completely unheard message.

1.  **Communicating with Diverse Populations**

Communicating with people from other cultures or groups can be challenging.

**For an advocate to be effective, you must be aware of what your nonverbal language is communicating and open to understanding the nonverbal communication cues of the survivor.**

To do this effectively, you will need to learn about cultures in the area where you serve. Learning about greetings, conversational style and nonverbal communication will help you to support survivors much more effectively.

Here are some tips:

_1\. Learn to recognize cues:_ Be adaptable to the survivor’s behavior. Observe the survivor and how they are behaving, then try to mirror their behavior. For example, if the survivor is leaning forward, you could learn forward too.

_2\. Accommodate the differences:_ What is considered normal in one culture may be insulting in another. Remain aware of how the survivor is reacting to you and remain patient and accommodating.

_3\. Never assume:_ Never assume that because the survivor is from a certain culture, they will behave a certain way. Values and beliefs are personal. Be aware of your own interpretations of other’s nonverbal behavior, and realize that mistaken assumptions lead to misinterpretations and miscommunication.

_4\. If in doubt, ask:_ There is no better tool for effective communication, regardless of culture, than asking. If you do or say something that seems to strike the survivor as inappropriate or offensive, simply ask if you have done anything wrong and what you can do to remedy the situation.

1.  **Special Considerations**

**Sexual assault survivors from different groups, or within a country, culture or community have special considerations that advocates need to consider.**

In this section, we will explore considerations for dealing with survivors from populations who require additional advocacy, including how to support survivors under the age of 18 and survivors from the LGBTQIA community.

**Sexual assault and other crimes motivated by the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation of any person are called hate crimes.**

Many countries have laws that specifically identify hate crimes and seek to protect all their citizens from being targeted for their diversity.

*   1.  **Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault**

Drug-facilitated sexual assault is often called “date rape,” because it often (but not always) happens in the context of a date between two people who may be romantically interested in each other.

**There are many false beliefs about sexual assault that can lead to different parts of society blaming the survivor for the event.**

Perpetrators manipulate and take advantage of our expectations to commit the crime of drug-facilitated sexual assault in three main ways:

1\. _Perpetrators have criminal intent_: Sexual assault does not happen by accident. The perpetrator plans the process in advance and while they may not consider their actions sexual assault, they have thought through the assault and decided that they will do whatever it takes to have sex with the survivor. When they decide that, they cross the line into criminal behavior.

2\. _The perpetrator involves alcohol and drugs_: Alcohol and drugs incapacitate people and make them easier to isolate. By separating the survivor from their friends and support network, the perpetrator puts themselves in a power and control in that situation.

3\. _Perpetrators need to isolate the survivor_: This physical and social isolation creates a situation where the perpetrator can manipulate what is happening and take away the survivor’s power.

*   *   1.  **Warning Signs of Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault**

After drug-facilitated sexual assault, a survivor often wakes up confused and wondering what happened beforehand.

They may start to remember parts of the assault and that they did not consent to what happened, whether or not they explicitly said “no” or not. They may feel angry and hurt, or embarrassed and ashamed.

**Survivors often withdraw and do not want to talk about or address the sexual assault immediately, although getting early support is crucial to recovery.**

Warning signs of drug-facilitated sexual assault include but are not limited to:

_- Feeling significantly more intoxicated than you should be after what you have consumed_

_- If a familiar drink tastes strange or salty (this might not be noticeable if the drink is sugary)_

_- If a bystander or friend intrudes to offer help that would put them alone with the person they are helping_

_- Lingering after-effects of intoxication that last longer than usual, for example all day or several days_

_- Waking up refreshed with no memory of what happened the night before, including how you got there_

_- Missing large chunks of time from memory about the night before_

_- Hallucinations, including feelings of floating, and thinking that they are seeing or experiencing things that do not make sense_

_- A sudden collapse or a head snap, if someone can no longer stand because they are losing muscle control_

_- Teeth grinding, feeling overheated and thirsty_

Although there are many pharmaceutical substances that can be used for drug-facilitated sexual assault, alcohol is by far the most common.

*   *   1.  **Alcohol and Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault**

Although alcohol is legally not available to youth under 18 or 21, depending on the laws in your country, it can still be quite easy for someone underage to obtain.

**Alcohol is much more prevalent than some of the other drugs that can be used in drug-facilitated sexual assault.**

People are more likely to accept alcohol from a stranger than drugs.

For example, someone in a bar offering to buy someone a drink and starting a conversation is considered socially normal. Because it is acceptable to do this, we are more willing to accept alcohol and trust that the person and the situation are okay.

**Societal factors make it easier for a perpetrator to use alcohol to manipulate and coerce a situation to their benefit and to have power over the survivor.**

In certain contexts, there can be strong peer pressure to drink and become intoxicated. This is especially true among young people and people in university or campus environments.

It is socially acceptable in many places to drink until you become intoxicated. For example, there are many jokes about what drunk people do, games to get drunk, and different methods to make people drink faster.

Many people do not see alcohol as a drug or believe that it is dangerous. Because it is widely advertised, people think that it cannot be so bad.

Many people who drink alcohol do not actually know how much a serving of alcohol is or looks like. One serving of hard liquor fits in a shot glass.

This is important to measure because we often see drinks being served that are much larger or are served drinks that have an unknown quantity of alcohol. Added sugar also masks the taste of alcohol, making it difficult to determine how many servings are in one drink.

For example, someone has been given a large glass of an unknown alcoholic drink and they drink it all. They think that one glass equals one serving, but in fact the drink could have multiple servings.

If this is more than someone planned to drink that night, then they may quickly become intoxicated and not be fully aware of it.

**Once they are intoxicated, a perpetrator can quickly isolate a survivor, for example by pretending to be taking care of them and leaving with the survivor for another location.**

People who are overly intoxicated are not able to give consent. This is the type of manipulation that leads to drug-facilitated sexual assault.

*   *   1.  **Context of Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault**

**The context of drug-facilitated sexual assault can include some consensual behavior.**

For example, a survivor may say, “I want to go outside because it is hot in here,” or “We cannot hear each other talking.”

The perpetrator, with criminal intent, will use this as an opportunity to suggest leaving the area.

Friends may see the survivor choosing to do something unsafe, for example, driving while drunk. They may see that the survivor doing something that they would not do while sober.

**If friends are not educated about sexual assault, they may not be able to recognize the warning signs of the situation.**

For example, friends may see the survivor leaving with someone they find unusual. They may find the situation funny or not see any reason to be concerned.

Another example of some consensual behavior that may occur in the context of drug-facilitated sexual assault is sexual activity at any level.

The survivor may be unable to participate because of their intoxication level or they may vomit. Someone who is intoxicated at this level is unable to give consent.

After the event or in the morning, the survivor may be confused about how the event ended. They may remember being so intoxicated that they were unable to participate in sexual activity.

Perhaps they had expected the event to be romantic but after some time has passed, the survivor sees the event much differently. They not remember large pieces of the event and they may feel regrets.

**There is no legal limit that makes someone too intoxicated to give consent to sexual activity.**

To determine if someone could give consent, we need to look at each individual situation and see what occurred in this context.

**With drug-facilitated sexual assault, we identify a cycle where the perpetrator manipulates the situation to their advantage to have power and control.**

Perpetrators use isolation to get someone alone and away from their support network, so they can manipulate and take advantage of them.

**They often manipulate what is socially acceptable to make their behavior seem normal, for example offering to buy alcoholic drinks or pressuring someone to go someplace private where they can be alone.**

For example, the perpetrator can often self-present as a kind and caring person or even a hero by offering to walk someone home or take care of them at a party.

**The issue is that the assault is premeditated and that the survivor is targeted by the perpetrator.**

Often, perpetrators of sexual assault have a sense of entitlement that they can have sex with whoever they want. They may also have violent or sexual trauma in their background and a lack of self-control. Perpetrators often distort reality and tell themselves that the survivor was inviting their attention and the assault.

After the assault, the perpetrator will likely use justification to deny that what happened was sexual assault. They may allude to false beliefs about sexual assault to try to blame the survivor.

**The responsibility for sexual assault always rests with the perpetrator.**

No matter what risky behavior a survivor participates in, it is always the perpetrator who decides to commit sexual assault.

*   *   1.  **False Beliefs about Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault**

**Perpetrators of drug-facilitated sexual assault may have the following false beliefs:**

_- That it is acceptable to “take advantage” of a person who is high or drunk_

_- That if the survivor was taking drugs or drinking alcohol, they are at fault for the sexual assault, not the perpetrator_

_- That an intoxicated person can legally give consent and that they consented to the sexual assault_

_- That using drugs and alcohol to purposely intoxicate someone so that it will be easier to sexually assault them is socially acceptable behavior_

_- That someone who does not consent can be persuaded by taking drugs or drinking alcohol_

These false beliefs are very harmful parts of many societies.

With knowledge about sexual assault and its impacts, our new awareness can help us intervene when we encounter these false beliefs in ourselves or others.

*   *   1.  **Types of Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault**

Side effects of drugs used for drug-facilitated sexual assault include:

_- Decreasing the survivor’s inhibitions, so they would say “yes” to something that they normally would not say yes to_

_- Unconsciousness or memory loss, when someone does not remember what happened to them_

Here is a short list of some drugs that are often used for drug-facilitated sexual assault:

- _Rohypnol (“Roofies”_): The round white pill, similar in size to an aspirin, is a legal sleeping drug in many countries. It is often crushed into powder so it can be easily sprinkled onto food or added to liquids, where it dissolves very quickly. Rohypnol is odorless, colorless and tasteless in powder form and it takes about 30 minutes to notice its effects.

Because of its use in drug-facilitated sexual assault, pharmaceutical companies tried to make Rohypnol turn blue when added to liquids, but they did not succeed and the drug remains almost impossible to detect.

- _Gamma-Hydroxybutyric (GHB)_: This clear or light-colored liquid can also come in powder form. It can be produced in a lab and is made with common commercially-available chemicals.

- _Ketamine_: A legal anesthetic, ketamine is an effective pain treatment that can cause amnesia.

- _Ecstasy_: Manufactured in labs, ecstasy has many names. If someone is on ecstasy their inhibitions are lowered and they experience a sense of euphoria; it can appear that they are giving consent but if they are under the influence of a drug, they cannot consent.

*   *   1.  **Risk Reduction Strategies**

Bystander intervention can help to reduce the rates of drug-facilitated sexual assault. Risk happens on a spectrum, so while you can’t say “If I do these things, I will always be safe,” you can say, “How can I keep myself safest?”

It can help to pay attention to:

_- How much you and your friends are drinking to make sure that you don’t become overly intoxicated;_

_- How many drinks are being served to you by someone else_

_- People’s reactions to alcohol, especially if it looks like they are falling or passing out_

_- Where your friends are; discourage them from wander alone, especially in unfamiliar or isolated places_

**In general, trust your instincts and intervene when something makes you feel uncomfortable or does not feel right.**

Bystander intervention is not just about trying to prevent people from becoming targets of drug-facilitated sexual assault — it is also about stopping people from being potential perpetrators.

It is important to remember that when alcohol or drugs are added to a situation, it can be difficult to read verbal and nonverbal cues.

Unless we get consent from our partners, we put them and ourselves in a risky situation.

**Not saying “no” does not mean “yes.”**

To create more safety for ourselves and others, we need to examine the risk factors and understand how to navigate them.

*   1.  **LGBTQIA Survivors**

Sexual violence is an important concern for individuals and communities who identify as LGBTQIA (for more information, see the section “Supporting LGBTQAI Survivors”).

This is because they may be at higher risk of sexual victimization than others and encounter barriers to services because of homophobia and transphobia.

Survivors who identify as LGBTQIA have a higher risk of taking part in high-risk sexual behaviors, depression and suicide attempts.

**When seeking medical care after sexual assault or intimate partner violence, LGBTQIA survivors may face additional barriers to accessing services.**

Other systems of discrimination and inequality increase the risk and the challenges.

**It is the survivor’s choice whether to disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity, and to whom they chose to disclose.**

If their partner threatens the survivor by telling them that they will disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity to others, unless they have sex, that is abuse.

*   *   1.  **Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity**

Everyone has a sexual orientation and gender identity. There are several different terms related to sexual orientation and gender identity we summarize here.

**Please be aware that in your community, the vocabulary and definitions may be different.**

Identity terms are complicated, and creating a description that works perfectly for everyone using that label is not possible.

_Gender:_ Gender is a socio-cultural system that says some people are masculine and some people are feminine, based on certain characteristics that vary between cultures and communities.

_Sex:_ Refers to a person’s genital organs, chromosomes or secondary sex characteristics; commonly ‘male,’ ‘female’ or ‘intersex.’

_Heterosexual_: Someone emotionally, physical and/or sexually attracted to a sex other than their own.

_Lesbian_: A woman who is primarily emotionally, physically and/or sexually attracted to other women.

_Gay_: Someone who is primarily emotionally, physically and/or sexually attracted to members of the same sex and/or gender; often used to refer to men who are primarily emotionally, physically and/or sexually attracted to other to other men, but can be applied to women and/or the queer community, to anyone who does not identify as a heterosexual.

_Bisexual_: Someone emotionally, physical and/or sexually attracted to people of their own gender and another gender, but not necessarily simultaneously or equally.

_Transgender_: Someone whose gender identity differs from the social expectations of the physical sex they were born with, because biological sex, which is one’s body (genitals, chromosomes, etc.) is different than social gender, which refers to their levels of masculinity and/or femininity.

**Gender and sex are not the same.**

_Queer_: Used as an umbrella term to describe individuals who do not identify as straight, or to describe people who have a non-normative gender identity. Please note that historically this was used as a derogatory term so it is not embraced or used by all members of the LGBTQIA community.

_Intersex_: This is a general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male.

_Asexual_: Someone who does not experience sexual attraction. Unlike celibacy, which people choose, asexuality is an intrinsic part of who someone is.

*   *   1.  **Supporting LGBTQIA Survivors**

People who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex or asexual (LGBTQIA) can experience bias-related behavior such as hate violence or hate crimes.

**LGBTQIA people also may be victims of sexual violence, intimate partner or domestic violence, and homophobic, transphobic or heterosexist violence.**

LGBTQIA people have diverse and intersecting races, ethnicities, classes, subcultures, sexual orientations, and variations in gender identity and expression. Racism, sexism, classism, and other forms of discrimination affect LGBTQIA people.

Their identities as LGBTQIA and as people of color, poor people, as men and women, cannot be separated.

Survivors may experience violence because of their race, gender and class identities; their identities as LGBTQIA; or, most often, because of both.

**Many countries have laws to protect LGBTQIA people, however sexual violence against LGBTQIA people persists and is pervasive.**

Much of this is either not understood or is ignored by mainstream media, and sometimes even service providers. Most first responders (law enforcement, government agencies, healthcare providers) do not track data on sexual orientation or gender identity, so there is very little data.

The safety of all LGBTQIA survivors depends on recognizing, understanding, and planning around the barriers that survivors face both because of violence and because of their identities.

*   1.  **Child Sexual Abuse**

Because children cannot consent to any sexual behavior, having sex with anyone under the age of 13 is automatically considered rape.

**For child survivors, sexual assault can impair a child’s development in ways that lead to lifetime challenges.**

The laws against statutory sexual assault vary by country, as do the ages at which teenagers are assumed to be able to give legal consent to have sex.

Usually, these laws protect young adolescents, from 13 onwards, from having sex with someone who is four or more years older than them, because of issues of power and control.

*   1.  **Adolescent Survivors**

Older people can manipulate young adolescents into a sexual relationship if they are using money to buy them gifts, or using alcohol, or buying cigarettes or drugs from them, or if they allow adolescents to do things that their parents would not let them do, in exchange for sexual behaviors.

Many survivors of sexual assault are under the age of 18\. The perpetrator is usually someone who they know. Children and adolescents who experience sexual violence have a greater risk of experiencing it again as adults.

**Without appropriate crisis intervention, sexual violence in youth can result in immediate and lifelong consequences.**

Addressing adolescent sexual assault is complex because legal definitions of children and youth differ by country. A significant number of perpetrators are youth themselves.

Most adolescent survivors do not tell their parents or other adults about the assault, but they may tell a friend so that they can get support without having to involve the police or their parents.

**By the age of 18, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men will experience sexual assault.**

Girls and boys who are sexually abused as children carry that trauma with them into adulthood and the impact of this on their mental, emotional and physical health can be significant.

For adolescent survivors who were sexually assaulted by a family member or caretaker, you may be mandated to notify the appropriate authorities.

*   1.  **Human Trafficking**

The definition for human trafficking is commercial sex acts or forced labor induced by force, fraud or coercion.

Often, we think of human trafficking as alien smuggling, meaning bringing people illegally across the border.

**Human trafficking does not have to involve the movement of people; it is a crime against the person themselves.**

In human trafficking, the survivor does not consent to their situation and they are being forcibly exploited.

**For minors under 18, there does not need to be any proof of force, fraud or coercion because minors under 18 cannot consent to sexual activity.**

Sex trafficking can include many types of commercial sex work, including dancing, prostitution and domestic servitude. Survivors are often confined so that they cannot leave, and denied food, water and medical care.

Survivors of human trafficking may be particularly vulnerable because many have previously experienced violence or abuse, or may not have a way to meet their own basic needs.

**Sex trafficking of minors within their own countries is also an issue.**

Adolescents who run away from home are at dangerous risk of become sex trafficked minors because recruiters usually make contact with adolescent runaways within 48 hours of them leaving home and becoming homeless.

**We often have stereotypes of what trafficked people look like that are inaccurate and that keep us from correctly identifying survivors in our neighborhoods and communities.**

These can include, but are not limited to, the false beliefs that trafficked people must be injured, dirty, drug-addicted or from another country.

As an advocate, asking the right questions can help determine if somebody is a victim of human trafficking. We want to be sure to create a safe environment for that person to disclose, if they chose to.

If you suspect that a survivor is being trafficked, you can shift your questions towards whether the survivor was being paid to participate in the sexual assault.

Some questions to determine if a survivor is being trafficked can include:

_- Did anyone take photos of you? If so, what did they use them for?_

_- Did anyone ever force you to engage in sex through online websites, informal arrangements or escort services?_

_- Are you required to meet a certain amount of money or nightly quota by engaging in sex? If you do not meet the quota, are there consequences?_

_- Are you threatened with violence or being deprived of water or food?_

_- Are you locked up, shut in your room, or not allowed to communicate with family and friends?_

_- Are you afraid that someone might harm your family?_

**Much like intimate partner violence, survivors of sex trafficking face a significant fear of sexual and physical abuse if they try to leave.**

Like intimate partner violence, perpetrators use brainwashing techniques to convince the survivor that they will not be able to survive without them — especially if the survivor is afraid that she will be prosecuted for commercial sex work without the protection of her trafficker.

Adolescents often run away because there is not a safe situation at home, and if they are trafficked, the situation is much worse. They may fear that changing their situation again risks making things even worse.

**Especially if the trafficker is holding the survivor’s identity documents, leaving may feel unsafe and almost impossible.**

*   1.  **Campus and University Survivors**

Campus sexual assault happens at colleges and universities around the world.

Survivors of campus and university sexual assault come from a variety of populations and can be any gender, sexual orientation, race and socioeconomic status. They may be citizens of the country or international studies targeted for their lack of status in the country, as well as students with and without disabilities.

When safety planning with survivors of campus sexual assault, the university can provide services to ensure that the survivor can avoid contact with the perpetrator in classes, housing, activities, programs or the workplace.

**Safety planning can be done whether the survivor reports to the police or seeks a formal university investigation.**

See the section on “How to Safety Plan” for more information.

*   1.  **Indigenous and Native Survivors**

There are several challenges that survivors from indigenous and native communities potentially face when seeking medical treatment after sexual assault.

Survivors may experience pressure to avoid reporting the sexual assault, leaving them feeling helpless and hopeless.

**Indigenous and native populations are often small and survivors may not be sure where to turn for help and may worry over confidentiality.**

There may be a language barrier if the survivor’s primary language is not the one spoken by you or the health service providers.

Geographical isolation in remote and rural areas may also keep them from seeking help.

Financial constraints may make it difficult for survivors to leave their communities to find health treatment.

Some women may not report intimate partner violence for fear of losing custody of their children.

Survivors face the possibility of intimidation by, and fear of, the perpetrator and the perpetrator’s family, as well as other members of the community, for speaking up.

**The lack of sufficient health services in various indigenous and native communities is another challenge survivors encounter, as they often have limited options when seeking help.**

In working with indigenous or native populations, it is important to understand the historical trauma these groups have faced, and how those experiences shape their current cultures as well as their reaction to seeking health services.

*   1.  **Survivors with Disabilities**

People with disabilities may have difficulty moving, speaking, seeing or hearing. Or, they may have intellectual issues that affect understanding.

**A disability may be very visible or not visible at all.**

It is important to remember that no two people are alike, no two people with disabilities are alike, and no two people with the same disability are alike.

We cannot simply say “survivors with disabilities need this or want that.”

**If we want to know what a survivor with a disability needs, we must ask them directly.**

Survivors with disabilities may or may not lack resources or support systems, be isolated, or be able to communicate in a traditional manner.

There are many ways people can be affected both by sexual assault and by disabilities, and these can change over time.

**To be an effective advocate, you must learn from the survivor.**

Listen for what they need, and do not make assumptions.

*   1.  **Survivors with Mental Health Issues**

Often, people within the general population have misconceptions and biases about mental illness that can create stigma.

As a result, people with serious mental illness may be treated poorly or differently from others, even by health service providers.

It is important to show respect to all survivors, including those with serious mental illness. It is inappropriate to use language such as “crazy,” “psycho,” or “nuts” either directly to a survivor suffering from mental illness or to refer to them with other people, including health service providers.

**Be aware of how you communicate, as survivors with mental illness have special needs that need to be addressed in specific ways.**

Someone with a mental illness or mental health issues may be especially vulnerable to sexual assault. The stress of experiencing sexual assault can worsen or intensify a survivor’s prior mental health condition.

If survivors are extremely agitated, distracted, uncommunicative, or displaying inappropriate emotional responses, notify a health service provider immediately as the survivor may be experiencing a psychiatric crisis.

As an advocate, it is important to recognize when you are no longer able to support a survivor because of their mental health issues, and to be willing to refer them to a qualified healthcare provider.

If you are comfortable advocating for a survivor with mental health issues, approach them as you would any other survivor. Try to establish trust and a feeling of sympathetic understanding, and present a calm, nonthreatening and reassuring manner. You may need to spend additional time in the beginning to establish rapport and to help the survivor understand your role.

Given that some survivors may be overwhelmed with trauma reactions in addition to pre-existing distressing symptoms, keep your interactions simple and brief. Survivors may not be capable of rational discussion on some or all topics.

Survivors may be overwhelmed by delusions, paranoia or hallucinations, and may feel threatened by you or afraid of you. They may have had prior negative experiences with other people in a similar role to you.

**As much as possible, help survivors feel they are in control of the situation.**

Introduce yourself by name first, and explain your role as a sexual assault advocate.

However, even survivors who are experiencing delusions, paranoia or hallucinations may still be able to accurately provide information and informed consent to medical treatment and forensic exams.

*   1.  **Homeless Survivors**

Being homeless is commonly associated with four categories:

1\. People who are living in a place not meant for human habitation, an emergency shelter, or transitional housing.

2\. People who are losing their primary nighttime residence, which may include a motel, hotel, or sharing situation and who lack resources or support networks to remain in housing.

3\. Families with children or unaccompanied youth under 25 years of age who are unstably housed and likely to continue in that state.

4\. People who are fleeing or attempting to flee intimate partner violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening situations related to violence, who have no other residence, and who lack the resources or support networks to obtain other permanent housing.

**Homeless youth, particularly from the LGBTQIA community, are particularly vulnerable to sexual assault.**

Survivors of intimate partner violence and domestic violence often face homelessness when they have experienced victimization in their homes and need to find safe housing to become safe and recover from trauma. The lack of safe housing and economic resources are primary concerns among survivors who are planning to leave or have recently left abusers.

In addition to supporting survivors as they receive medical treatment for sexual assault, safety planning is especially important for advocates supporting homeless survivors (see the section, “How to Safety Plan”).

1.  **BELIEVE**

**Believe**: As an advocate, it is not your job to decide if what the survivor is saying is true, illegal or “qualifies” as sexual assault.

1.  **Navigating Disclosure**

It can be helpful for advocates to recognize that prior to arriving at the health center, the survivor may have previously shared with someone else about the sexual assault and that they may not have been treated compassionately or even believed.

In health center contexts, a healthcare provider may have pressured them to disclose before they were ready, in order to receive services, or may have reacted by blaming the survivor or strongly discouraging them from disclosing at all.

**Unfortunately, it is very common for survivors to receive negative responses to disclosing about their sexual assault.**

Rather than being helpful and supportive, or even listening, it is not unusual for survivors to be blamed for the sexual assault by others, including healthcare providers.

Sexual assault is a crime, and it is important for healthcare providers and others to recognize that when they blame the survivor for the crime that was committed against them, they let the perpetrator of the crime go free.

**Anticipating your own reactions to disclosure in advance will help you to plan better ways to respond to the survivor.**

When listening to the survivor’s disclosure, it is important to recognize that you will likely feel uncomfortable and that the situation will likely be more difficult and complicated than you imagined.

Your urge to be helpful may end up with blaming the survivor or trying to fix something that is beyond your ability to fix.

*   1.  **Barriers to Disclosure**

It is very important that survivors are given the opportunity to process their own experience, without the advocate trying to do this for them.

**There are often multiple barriers that survivors face when choosing to disclose a sexual assault and seek medical assistance.**

The most common barriers faced by survivors are:

_- Not being believed:_****The fear that they will not be believed is usually the biggest obstacle to disclosure faced by a survivor of sexual assault.

Fears about who will believe them are compounded by any feelings of guilt, shame and self-blame, as well as potential embarrassment in talking about what happened.

In addition, the perpetrator may have threatened the survivor to stay silent by saying that they won’t be believed, or by threatening to harm a friend, family member or pet, or threatening to post photos or information online to ruin their reputation.

As an advocate, navigating the survivor’s fear that they will not be believed is especially challenging when confronted with untrained healthcare providers who challenge or don’t believe the survivor’s story.

_- Other people’s reactions_: These can include strong responses of sadness, anger, disbelief or wanting to seek revenge.

Unfortunately, strong reactions put the feelings of the person who is reacting before the feelings of the survivor.

When strong reactions come from someone the survivor trusts, the survivor often becomes afraid and starts to doubt of they did the right thing to disclose.

If this happens, the survivor then often tires to protect the other person, because they do not want to hurt them, rather than staying with their own experience and trying to get the support they need.

**As an advocate, supporting the survivor during disclosure is not about you. Your role is to be supportive and helpful.**

You may have very strong feelings, which is normal. While you may need to speak with someone about them afterwards, in the moment it is essential not to take the focus away from the survivor and their story.

_- Trauma:_ Sexual assault is often a highly traumatic experience, so it is important for advocates to understand what trauma is and how trauma impacts survivors.

**Trauma is an experience that overwhelms our capacity to have a sense of control over ourselves and our immediate environment.**

During sexual assault, the survivor does not have control over their own body and this is naturally both upsetting and uncomfortable.

Trauma overwhelms our ability to maintain connection with others and after sexual assault, when our sense of trust has been violated, it can be extremely difficult to trust and reach out to someone.

While you might think that anyone who has been sexually assaulted would want to come forward, in fact the violation of trust that the survivor has experienced make the very act of disclosing unsafe.

Because of trauma, it can feel safer not to trust people and for the survivor to withdraw into themselves.

_- Self-blame_: Trauma overwhelms our ability to make meaning of our experience. Survivors never get to ask the perpetrators, “Why did you do this to me?” All the same, these questions take time to go away.

**Often, the survivor turns their questions inwards and their experience of sexual assault becomes self-blame.**

They may think that they were sexually assaulted because they did something wrong, for example going to the wrong place, speaking to the wrong person, or making a wrong decision, but this is not the case.

Self-blame becomes a barrier to disclosure because the survivor may fear that they will not be believed, or that they will be blamed for the sexual assault that happened to them.

If the survivor is experiencing self-blame, focus on what the perpetrator did to violate boundaries and commit a crime.

It is always appropriate to emphasize that the survivor did nothing wrong and that the sexual assault is not their fault.

*   1.  **Reasons for Disclosure**

Disclosing sexual assault is a courageous and challenging process.

Here are some reasons that a survivor may decide to disclose and to seek assistance:

- _Stopping the silence_: Keeping sexual assault a secret has extremely negative mental, emotional and physical health consequences for the survivor, and these can quickly become unmanageable.

**A survivor may disclose and seek help to stop suffering in silence.**

For survivors experiencing situations of repeated sexual assault, there may be a hope that if someone else knows, the behavior can stop.

- _Stopping the perpetrator_: Survivors often disclose because they want to stop the perpetrator from doing the same thing to other people.

- _Getting healthcare and support_: In disclosing, a survivor may then be able to receive healthcare and support for their healing process.

Whether they are physically injured, worried they could become pregnant, or they fear getting a sexually transmitted infection, they will need to disclose to receive the appropriate medical treatment.

_- Getting justice_: The survivor may want the perpetrator to be held accountable for the crime they have committed. Perhaps they want to community to know what has happened or to go through the legal justice process.

*   1.  **Responding to Disclosure**

After disclosure, the survivor may have questions about what will happen next.

If the perpetrator is someone that the survivor trusts and loves, there may be confusion about the outcomes. The survivor may insist that they do not want the perpetrator to get into trouble, they only want the abuse to stop.

The survivor may feel intense guilt and self-blame around the fact that by disclosing, the survivor may get the perpetrator into trouble, even though it is the perpetrator who did something wrong.

Because of the consequences, there are often far more reasons to stay silent than there are to disclose.

**When a survivor does disclose, we want to validate the person and recognize how much courage and strength it takes to come forward.**

We want to recognize and honor the barriers they had to face and the consequences of their choice to speak up and get support.

When you respond to disclosure, are some things you can reflect to the survivor:

_- How brave they are to be honest about what happened._

_- How strong they are for coming forward_

_- That you believe them._

_- That you are sorry that this happened to them._

_- That the feelings they are experiencing are normal._

_- That the assault was not their fault._

_- That they did what they needed to stay safe._

_- That you cannot make promises about what will happen in the future._

_For example, as an advocate, you cannot guarantee that the survivor will not have to speak to the police, or that the sexual assault will stay a secret from their family._

_- That what happens next is up to the survivor and it is their choice to make._

Every survivor processes sexual assault differently and as an advocate, you will be faced with many different situations.

For example, a survivor may tell their story and break down in tears, while another may be extremely angry and tense.

Others may show no apparent emotion, or laugh nervously when disclosing, which may tempt you or others to dismiss their story.

A survivor&#039;s reaction may be an indication that they are not able to handle or cope with the intense feelings that are coming up.

**Remember that all survivors cope differently and all responses are valid.**

Be aware that you might have strong feelings triggered by a survivor&#039;s disclosure, whether from what they are sharing or the way they are sharing it.

It is important to keep the focus on the survivor and validate their feelings, and to stay in their experience in your role as an advocate.

After your time with the survivor is complete, you will need to take time for your own processing (see the section, Self-Care for Advocates).

It may take practice to affirm and support the survivor, especially when you feel triggered.

Saying the wrong thing or saying something in the wrong way can shut down the process of disclosure for someone.

**It can be helpful to role play with other advocates so that you are more comfortable in the moment, knowing what to say.**

At the same time, we do not want to put too much focus on survivor&#039;s feelings as they are disclosing, because we want to give them the time and space for a variety of feelings and they need to feel safe. This safety includes physical protection from the perpetrator, but also a sense of security from having you as an advocate beside them.

**Ask the survivor what they need, to help give them a sense of security and control over their environment.**

It could be water, a blanket, food, or something else that makes them feel more comfortable. Often the health center will have these things available and a healthcare provider will be able to get the for the survivor. Try to stay next to the survivor as much as possible.

**You are doing your job as an advocate when you listen to and believe the survivor, and try to be helpful and supportive.**

You do not need to be, or act like, an expert.

It can often feel like you are not doing enough, but the ability for you to offer unconditional support to the survivor can be a crucial step in their path to healing.

While you may sometimes feel overwhelmed in your role as an advocate, you do not need to have all the answers to help a survivor get the support they need.

**Often there is additional shame and silence around disclosing sexual assault related to intimate partner violence.**

In cases of intimate partner violence, it can be helpful to repeat to the survivor that just because they consented to be in a previous situation does not mean that they automatically consent to all future situations.

Consent must be given every time.

*   1.  **Post-Traumatic Stress**

Post-traumatic stress happens after exposure to a situation where severe physical harm occurred or was threatened.

Sexual assault often causes post-traumatic stress, which includes but is not limited to the following symptoms:

_- Flashback episodes or strong memories of the event_

_- Nightmares, trouble sleeping or other sleep disturbances_

_- Troubling thoughts, especially when exposed to reminders of the event_

_- Frequent disassociation_

_- Intense guilt_

_- Depressing and anxiety_

_- Irritability or angry outbursts_

_- Headaches or migraines_

_- Dizziness or chest pain_

_- Fatigue_

_- Stomach problems_

_- Immune system problems_

_- Increased blood pressure_

_- Problems with intimacy_

_- Drug or alcohol abuse_

_- Suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts_

Most survivors with post-traumatic stress try to avoid thinking about or being reminded of the event.

Symptoms of post-traumatic stress usually begin within a few months of a traumatic event, but can also develop many years later.

**Once post-traumatic stress begins, its severity and duration varies greatly from survivor to survivor.**

Research shows that reviewing the event with the survivor very soon after it occurs may reduce some symptoms.

Research also shows that if survivors experience numbness or emotional distancing, they may be more at risk of developing post-traumatic stress.

The effects of post-traumatic stress are barriers to disclosure and reporting to law enforcement, which is why sexual assault is one of the least reported crimes in the world.

*   *   1.  **Trauma and Disclosure**

Disclosure is a process and not an event, and this process continues long after the survivor has left the health center.

The first time they disclose, most survivors do not tell the entire story from beginning to end.

Because disclosure happens in small parts, it can feel like a slow process for the advocate.

**It is important to be patient and listen to the survivor for as long as the disclosure process takes.**

One of the first steps of disclosure is denial.

Denial may happen when the survivor does not feel safe or when they are not ready to address what has happened.

Creating a trusting relationship and helping the survivor feel safe can help them move through denial.

Often, the survivor will partially disclosure to see how you respond.

**Research shows that if the first person a survivor tells about sexual assault believes them, they are more likely to move through disclosure towards healing.**

If a survivor meets with strong reactions from the first person they partially disclose to, full disclosure becomes much more difficult.

A survivor may reverse their story, contradict themselves or appear uncertain about what happened. It is important to be patient and supportive.

**The most important thing a survivor needs during disclosure is to be believed.**

It is not about you fixing the survivor’s problems in the moment, or trying to determine if something was illegal or what to do next.

Your job is simply to listen and support the survivor, and to recognize that they have survived something horrible and lived to share about it.

Reaffirm that what they did was the right thing to do, because they are still alive to talk about what happened: they are a survivor.

1.  **Negotiating with Healthcare Providers**

As an advocate, you will need to negotiate with healthcare providers to secure appropriate healthcare for the survivor.

Learning good negotiation skills will help your work be more effective and make it easier for you to help get the survivor the medical treatment they need.

At the center of negotiation is the idea that relationships can be strengthened through each interaction.

**Always treat your health center colleagues with politeness and respect.**

It can be helpful to understand potential sources of conflict so that you can better understand how to best negotiate and advocate for the survivor’s needs.

Here are a few examples:

- _Personal differences_: Your own values, beliefs, and life experiences differ from those of others, and this affects the way you perceive situations.

Clear communication helps bridge the differences between you, the survivor, healthcare providers, and other people in positions of leadership and authority.

- _Information differences_: You may have information regarding a survivor’s situation that differs from the information someone else may have.

Usually, this can be resolved by clarifying your communication with others while maintaining confidentiality.

- _Different objectives_: Your goals may not be aligned with the goals of others.

For example, you know that the healthcare provider needs the survivor’s story to prescribe treatment, but you also know that pushing the survivor will be painful and draining for them.

- _Environmental factors_: The structure and function of the health center is likely not adequate to meet the needs of sexual assault survivors.

For example, survivors may not want to speak with an advocate because they do not want to be identified as a sexual assault survivor.

*   1.  **Conflict Management**

Learning how to deal effectively with conflict when it arises is an important skill for advocates.

Different people handle conflict in different ways, and understanding a person’s conflict management style can help you to negotiate with them effectively. With practice, conflict can be managed, but not all conflict can be resolved.

Try to think of conflict not as something to win or lose at, but something that helps people articulate their needs and get them met.

Here are the five common conflict management styles that you may encounter in yourself or others:

1\. _Accommodating_: Someone has a high concern for others’ needs and exhibits passive behavior.

2\. _Collaborating:_ Someone has a high concern for others’ needs and exhibits assertive behavior.

3\. _Avoiding_: Someone has a low concern for others’ and their own needs, and exhibits passive behavior.

4\. _Forcing_: Someone has a high concern for their own needs and exhibits assertive behavior.

5\. _Compromising_: Someone balances concern for their needs with concern for others’, as well as exhibiting a mix of passive and assertive behavior.

All conflict management styles are useful and different styles can match different situations.

Rather than being fixed traits, conflict management styles overlap and often shift depending on the issue. Knowing your own style and being able to identify others’ styles can be a useful negotiation tool.

*   1.  **Negotiation Tips**

Whenever you are negotiating as an advocate, try to keep these four outcomes of good negotiation in mind.

You are trying to:

1\. Address the needs of the survivor

2\. Come to agreement, if possible

3\. Be efficient

4\. Improve, or not damage, relationships

**Remember to always communicate politely and respectfully to healthcare providers.**

The following tips can be helpful for negotiating:

_1\. Focus on interests, not positions_: Interests are the needs and goals that you would like to achieve on behalf of the survivor. Positions are the sides you take during a negotiation.

Be careful not to become emotionally involved with your position and do not take other people’s positions personally. Focus instead on meeting the survivor’s needs together.

You can do this by:

- Opening the conversation by asking the other person to help you address the survivor’s needs

- Look for a solution that will help the survivor now, rather than focusing on past events

- Address the problem — the survivor’s needs — and never verbally attack the person with whom you are speaking

- Identify shared and conflicting interests

- Acknowledge and discuss the different perspectives and interests

- Prioritize interests, but always put the survivor’s interests first

_2\. Generate a variety of options_: It is useful to collaborate with the other person to generate multiple problem-solving options when negotiating, especially if these options make the different interests compatible or even complementary.

Try to avoid the following group obstacles:

_- Deciding on an option too early on_

_- Forgetting that the survivor is the priority_

_- Defining the problem in win-lose terms_

_* One of the parties may decide that is up to the other to come up with a solution_

_3\. if things get difficult, define alternative approaches_: Sometimes you will not be able to come to agreement, even after a long discussion.

Even if your negotiation is not successful, you can still accomplish your goal and generate other options by:

_- Defining other ways to achieve your goal and help the survivor_

_- At the end of a negotiation, deciding together if you have fully achieved your goal_

_- Pointing out the benefits of your approach, if your alternative is better for the survivor than the option presented by the other person_

_- Taking a break and scheduling a follow-up, if necessary_

_4\. Insist on using objective criteria_: Agree with the other party about which criteria are legitimate and practical for the situation.

To do so:

_- State your position on behalf of the survivor in an assertive and cooperative way, but try not to use an avoiding or forcing style_

_- Decide together how both parties will assess whether the solution will work for the survivor_

_- Check each other’s perceptions of the “fairness” of the proposed solution_

_- Find a point on which you both can agree_

_5\. Communicate effectively_: Effective communication involves both talking and listening and is essential for an advocate to negotiate and collaborate effectively.

Try to:

_- See things from the other perspective_

_- Speak confidently_

_- Present yourself as self-assured and professional_

_- Avoid statements or words that may generate strong emotional reactions_

_- Listen attentively and without a defensive posture_

_- Clarify what is being said and paraphrase key points to ensure a common understanding_

_6\. Build strong relationships_: Create understanding, trust and respect when you communicate with healthcare providers.

It can help to:

_- Separate the person from the problem_

_- If you have negative opinions about the person you are negotiating with, do not let those feelings interfere_

_- Remain open and respectful_

_- Differences can be positive, so do not view differences as reason to become defensive_

_- Recognize how the conflict is affecting the negotiation and try to find mutually agreeable points_

_7\. Define commitments_: At the end of negotiations, define what everyone will do to reach resolution by discussing next steps.

Then close the discussion by:

_- Making sure your commitments are realistic and clearly defined_

_- Paraphrasing and summarizing the agreements_

_- Making sure everyone leaves knowing who will do what_

_- Arranging for a way to confirm commitments_

**As an advocate, you may face conflicts you need to manage through skilled negotiation.**

Effective negotiation is the result of knowledge and practice.

Even when negotiations are tense and uncomfortable, they can be viewed as opportunities to develop skills that can be used to benefit the survivor.

1.  **SUPPORT**

**Support**: Validate the survivor’s feelings. Help them take appropriate action or affirm their decision to do so.

1.  **An Overview of Medical Advocacy**

Medical treatment for survivors of sexual assault covers three important areas:

1\. Antibiotic treatment to prevent sexually-transmitted infections

2\. Antiretrovirals to reduce the likelihood of contracting HIV

3\. Emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy

**Before prescribing treatment, a healthcare provider will need to do a medical exam to evaluate the survivor for external or internal injuries.**

It is essential that the survivor give informed consent prior to the medical exam, and that they consent again during each stage of it.

**The medical exam can feel very intrusive and is often re-traumatizing for survivors, so it needs to be handled slowly and with sensitivity.**

During the medical exam, the healthcare provider documents and collects forensic evidence from the survivor, whose body is treated as a crime scene. This can be done even if the survivor is not ready to report the sexual assault to law enforcement, and even if they are not considering prosecuting the crime.

1.  **First Steps at the Health Center**

In some areas, if a survivor goes to the emergency room for medical care after sexual assault, a trained healthcare provider will do an exam to collect forensic evidence that can be used to prosecute in court.

Even if the healthcare provider in your area is not trained in how to do this, the material that follows can help a healthcare provider collect evidence that could be used in court.

When the survivor arrives at the health center, depending on the context, a nurse may do a quick examination to make sure they are not suffering from immediate injuries like bleeding or broken bones.

Usually, the survivor is considered not urgent and will be sent back into the waiting room with strict instructions not to eat, drink or use the toilet while they are waiting, so that they do not destroy any evidence.

At this point, the survivor may feel embarrassed, uncomfortable, ashamed, hurt and many other intense feelings, and be surrounded by the chaos of an emergency waiting room, where they may wait for hours until an exam room becomes available because of staffing and space issues.

**Without an advocate present to ensure that they are prioritized, the survivor may leave the health center after waiting for hours, before receiving treatment of any kind.**

Obviously, we want to avoid this situation.

If you are an advocate volunteering directly with a health center to support survivors of sexual assault, it is important that they know how to call you or your organization any time, day or night, when an advocate is needed.

**This is the case even if the survivor says that they do not want an advocate to come, because once you have an opportunity to introduce yourself and your role, the survivor may change their mind.**

When you are arranging to volunteer with health centers, be sure to give them an approximate response time based on how long it will take you or other advocates to arrive at the health center.

It is best if advocates can arrive at the health center within 30 minutes.

**Advocates support the survivor in the process that they are going through at the health center.**

They to help explain to survivors about the care and treatment available to them, and the survivor’s options regarding evidence collection and law enforcement.

If you are connected to other follow-up services in your community, you can also refer the survivor to those services.

Often, survivors are concerned about payment for health center services.

Because sexual assault is a crime, in many countries a survivor does not pay for medical services.

Your country may not yet have these policies in place, or you may need to remind healthcare providers of this policy so that it is enforced.

1.  **Navigating the Medical Exam**
    1.  **The Importance of the Medical Exam**

Sexual assault is one of the least reported crimes. Most sexual assaults that are reported are not successfully prosecuted.

**There are many reasons why cases are not successfully prosecuted through the system.**

For example, a survivor may not want to go through the court process or may decide to stop an active court process, or the police may not be able to gather enough evidence to make a strong case.

As advocates, we cannot control whether survivors chose to report or prosecute sexual assault.

**We can, however, control how evidence is collected at the health center and make sure that evidence is gathered in the best way possible to make the strongest case possible to take to court.**

Even if the survivor is not sure if they want to bring legal action against the perpetrator, they may choose to have the examination because they will then have better evidence to support making the choice later.

In many cases, a survivor will not be able to pay for medical treatment after a sexual assault. Because sexual assault is a crime, many health centers do not charge survivors for receiving treatment.

It is helpful to understand the situation at the health center you are volunteering at, as if the survivor is required to pay, this may be something you or your organization can support with in different ways.

*   1.  **Emergency Medical Advocacy**

**Once a healthcare provider starts the sexual assault evidence collection kit, specific steps need to be followed until the kit is complete to safeguard the chain of evidence.**

This process can be very challenging for the survivor. It is important for them to have an advocate with them to navigate their needs and sensitivities.

If the healthcare provider has not been trained to understand the impact of sexual assault, they may perceive the survivor as being difficult or unhelpful, and not understand why.

Throughout the health center visit, the advocate is there to support and help the survivor, to answer questions, and to be a liaison between the survivor and the healthcare providers, and the legal system.

Because of very normal trauma responses, the survivor may argue about not wanting to have certain parts of the medical exam done, or may stop interacting and seem like they are not connected to what is happening.

**At all times, the survivor’s consent must guide the process.**

If they agree to something and then withdraw their consent later, it is essential that their decisions be immediately observed and respected.

In addition to navigating consent, it is important for you, as the advocate, to understand how sexual assault impacts survivors and provide emotional support for them.

If the healthcare provider has been trained, they are better able to help the survivor cope with the situation as well as to collect evidence, in case the survivor, at that time or in the future, wants to prosecute in court.

In many countries and health centers, there are not yet healthcare providers who have been trained in how to appropriately interact with survivors and how to collect evidence to prosecute sexual assault.

Please note that when we use the term “untrained,” we are referring specifically to heath care provider training in how to interact with survivors and collect evidence in cases of sexual assault.

*   *   1.  **Medical Providers Trained to Work with Sexual Assault Survivors**

Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE) are healthcare providers who have been trained in how to interact with and collect evidence from sexual assault survivors.

This includes taking a medical forensic history, taking a detailed physical and emotional assessment, written/electronic and photographic documentation, collection and management of forensic samples, and providing emotional and social support and resources.

The trained nurse examiner testifies in any legal proceedings related to the examination and ensures the proper chain of custody and integrity of the samples is maintained so that evidence will be admissible in court.

The trained nurse examiner collaborates with others in the community who provide unique services to sexual assault survivors, including advocates, law enforcement, crime lab personnel, child protection and attorneys.

**With training, these professionals assure that the approach to sexually assault survivors in the community is survivor-centered and compassionate, resulting in a successful criminal justice response.**

For more information on how to access this training for the health centers where you advocate, see the “Additional Training” section.

*   1.  **What to Expect from a Forensic Exam**

In general, medical care after sexual assault is helpful for treating or preventing illness and injury, and is an important way to preserve evidence. For these reasons, it is important to get medical care as soon as possible.

Healthcare providers can offer:

_- A physical exam to identify any injuries_

_- Emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy_

_- Medication to prevent HIV and other sexually-transmitted infections_

_- Testing to determine if the survivor was given a drug or sedating substance_

**As an advocate, you are there to emotionally support the survivor as the healthcare provider goes through the medical exam and the process of collecting evidence.**

They may be feeling nervous, scared, angry, sad, confused, embarrassed or numb.

It can help to reassure the survivor that the sexual assault was not their fault.

**If a survivor has decided to take this course of action, it is important they not eat, drink, smoke or use the toilet until evidence is collected.**

If the survivor must use the toilet, a trained nurse can assist them.

**At all points during their visit to the health center, the survivor has a right to choose what care they want to receive. This is called “informed consent.”**

It is important that the survivor understand the forensic examination involves the collection and storage of evidence documenting, with photography, their injuries.

**The exam can be done whether the survivor wants to involve the police or not.**

It is important for the exam to be completed at the health center because it is time sensitive. The more time that passes after the assault, the more likely it is that potential evidence could be lost.

**During the exam, it is important that the survivor understand that they can change their mind at any time and stop the process.**

Just because they already signed forms or consented to the exam does not mean there is any pressure on them to have every process done during the exam.

It is always their right to choose what parts they want completed and what parts they do not want completed.

As an advocate, you may be asked to help the healthcare provider to go and get something they have forgotten, or to pass a message to a colleague. This is because once the evidence collection process has been started, the provider cannot leave the room without compromising the chain of evidence.

You may be asked to speak with family members who are at the health center: do this only if the survivor signs a release form authorizing you to (see the “Resources” section).

If this is the case, observe confidentiality and only pass on the information that the survivor requested you to.

For example, the survivor might ask you to go out to the waiting room to tell their partner or mother that they are okay, or to confirm that they are physically at the health center.

If the police arrive during the evidence collection process to speak with the survivor, you will need to ask them to wait until the process is completed.

*   *   1.  **Forensic Exam Overview**

During the exam, the healthcare provider will examine at the survivor from head to toe, looking for any injuries or following on any complaints of swelling, bruising or anything else.

With the survivor’s consent, they will then photograph those injuries.

If the equipment is available, they will examine the survivor’s body with a special light for dried fluids, which will be swabbed and packaged.

The survivor’s mouth and fingernails will also be swabbed with cotton-tipped wads, and their fingernails will be clipped.

At that point, if the survivor consents, they will lie down on the examining table and the healthcare provider will examine their genital area and, if consent is obtained, take photographs if needed.

The provider will take more swabs from different points on the survivor’s genitals.

**Once all the swabs have been collected, the evidence is packaged and, with the survivor’s consent, released to law enforcement to keep custody of the evidence if and until the survivor decides to prosecute in court.**

After the exam, the survivor needs to receive medical treatment to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections, HIV and pregnancy.

For more information about advocating with law enforcement, please see section “Connecting with Law Enforcement.”

*   *   1.  **Treatment Overview**

In addition to treatment for physical injuries and forensic evidence collection, the survivor needs to receive medical treatment for three key areas:

_1\. Antibiotics to reduce the risk of sexually-transmitted infections_

_2\. Antiretrovirals to reduce the risk of HIV transmission_

_3\. Emergency contraception to reduce the risk of pregnancy_

**In addition, if the survivor suspects they may have been drugged, blood work will need to be done.**

The sooner these laboratory tests are done, the better, as drugs can metabolize very quickly through the body.

Survivors may ask if they will be tested for sexually-transmitted infections as part of the forensic exam, but generally the answer is no. This is because it is too soon for these tests to show positive after exposure.

Bacterial sexually-transmitted infections can be prevented with antibiotics, which can be given by injection or pills.

HIV transmission may not always be a concern, but if the healthcare provider determines that the survivor is at risk, they will prescribe a course of antiretrovirals to reduce the likelihood of infection.

Emergency contraception prevents a fertilized egg from implanting and will not harm an existing pregnancy. It is also very safe for breastfeeding women to take.

It is important for a survivor to understand that emergency contraception does not prevent sexually-transmitted infections or HIV.

**It is necessary that the survivor follows the full course of treatment provided to them.**

The healthcare provider will schedule a follow-up visit for testing for sexually-transmitted infections, HIV and pregnancy after some time has passed.

It may be helpful for you to arrange to be present with the survivor for this visit to the health center as well.

*   1.  **Forensic Exam Steps**

Usually, a formal evidence collection kit comes in a box that has all the materials a healthcare provider will need. Inside the box there will be different envelopes, forms, bags and labels.

Just because parts of the kit may be labeled in order does not mean that they need to be completed in order.

**If the survivor has been waiting to use the toilet, prioritize the internal exam so that they can use the toilet before the exam continues.**

If the survivor is hungry or thirsty, prioritize the oral exam so that they can have something to eat or drink, and then continue the exam.

**If all the sections are completed, it does not matter in which order they are done.**

**The healthcare provider needs to ask the survivor for permission before beginning each step of the physical evidence collection and exam, and wait to receive consent before they start.**

During the processes, they need to check in with the survivor to see if they should pause before continuing, especially if the survivor seems to be, or indicates that they are, in distress.

**You may need to ask the healthcare provider to pause or be patient, as supporting the survivor in this way takes additional time but is essential to providing appropriate emotional support.**

For someone who has already been through sexual assault, the steps of the collection process can feel forced and nonconsensual, like a repeat of the assault in many ways.

**Navigate the process of consent at each step and do your best to support the survivor.**

There are several portions of external evidence collection.

At each stage, pause with the healthcare provider, ask them to explain to the survivor what the next step will involve, and ask again for consent before you continue.

Everything in the forensic exam is optional.

**The process of consent is the most important piece of your work as an advocate and must not be rushed or skipped.**

If the survivor chooses not to consent to a step in this process, the fact that they did not consent will be written on the envelope to show that this is an intentional part of the process and not missed by mistake.

*   *   1.  **Interview and Forms**

There are many forms that the healthcare provider needs to fill in to detail their information and the survivor’s information, including the hospital name and the date and time of the exam.

The survivor will need to complete a consent and release form indicating that they understand and consent to what will be done in the exam, and they only need to consent to the parts they are comfortable with.

**The survivor has every right to refuse parts of the exam that they are not comfortable with.**

It is important for the healthcare provider to get as much detail as possible about what happened.

For example, if the survivor waited hours or even days before coming to the health center, or if they showered before coming to the health center, this is important information to know as it will affect the evidence collected.

**When healthcare provider takes the survivor’s history, this is to help the provider diagnose and treat the survivor and to direct the collection of evidence.**

The consent and release forms ask the survivor detailed questions about their sexual history, general health, and drug and alcohol use to develop a picture of the event and what has happened.

There are male and female diagrams, and the health provider will ask the survivor about injuries they have on their body and make marks on the diagram where there may be bruises, scratches and other injuries.

All of this is to create a picture of what happened during the sexual assault for the prosecution if the case goes to trial, because months later these marks will no longer be visible.

*   *   1.  **Photographs**

Photographic evidence would only be taken if the healthcare provider has the survivor’s consent, both before the process and throughout.

Photographs document any injuries, including cuts and bruises, on the survivor’s body.

It is standard for two photographs to be taken of each injury. The first is a general photo of the injury and the second is with a ruler or other measuring device in the photo so that the size of the injury is clear.

This is necessary because if the case goes to trial, these visible injuries will probably have disappeared.

Taking as much information as possible is vitally important for prosecution, but not every survivor has injuries that need to be photographed.

**Just because a survivor may not have injuries or marks does not mean that sexual assault has not happened.**

Documenting injuries is necessary to paint a picture of what happened at the time of the assault, and the forensic exam is the one opportunity to capture this.

*   *   1.  **Clothing**

If the health center has a formal evidence collection kit, it will contain bags and envelopes to collect clothing from the survivor, including separate envelopes for undergarments.

Depending on the situation, the healthcare provider may ask them to remove some or all their clothing.

**Like all parts of the exam, this is optional.**

Whether the survivor decides to do this is their decision.

Because the survivor’s clothing will become evidence, it is not likely that it will be returned to them.

At this point, it can be helpful to have brought a spare set of clothes, including underwear, as the health center may not have any to provide (see the section, “Getting Started: What to Bring to the Health Center”).

The healthcare provider will then spread a large sheet of paper beneath the survivor as they disrobe, so that any foreign materials found on their clothing, for example leaves or coat fibers, can be collected and labelled properly.

For each section of evidence collection, materials need to be labelled clearly with the survivor’s name, the date and the name of the healthcare provider who collected it.

*   *   1.  **Taking Swabs**

**This process can feel very invasive, so it is important to explain to the survivor what will happen and to receive consent before the healthcare provider proceeds.**

If the right equipment is available, the provider will examine the survivor’s body with a special light that shows any dried fluids.

If this light is not available, the provider can use cotton-tipped wads to swab any areas where the survivor reported that the perpetrator was in contact with them. These areas will be swabbed and labelled slides made and packaged (see “Fixing the Slides” below).

Then, the healthcare provider will take a buccal swab, several swabs of cotton-tipped wads from inside the survivor’s mouth, to collect their own DNA.

This involves the survivor taking a plastic stick and rubbing it up and down the inside of their cheek, inside their mouth, about ten times. This creates a DNA sample that can then be compared against other samples.

Next, the survivor’s fingernails will be swabbed in the same way.

They will also be clipped as, because debris, fiber or skin can be underneath the fingernails could be important. The survivor may prefer to clip their fingernails themselves, so that they determine the length that they are cut.

*   *   1.  **Fixing the Slides**

If an evidence collection kit is available, it will include a larger number of cotton swabs to collect samples with, as well as many glass slides and a stand or other materials (like cups or stands) that help the slides air dry without touching any other surfaces.

For each swab collected, the healthcare provider makes a slide that will need to air dry for a minimum of one hour before they are packaged up.

**This is to fix the sample so that it will not degrade over time or grow mold and become unusable.**

Air drying is crucial to this process, so the slides must be clearly labelled and arranged so that they do not fall or touch each other over the one hour when they are drying.

*   *   1.  **Pubic Hair Combings**

At this stage, the survivor will sit on a drape and use a small comb on the pubic area to pick up any debris, fiber, hairs or anything else that could be collected as evidence.

**The healthcare provider may do this, or the survivor may prefer to do this step themselves.**

The whole drape is then folded and put into a labelled envelope.

If the survivor choses to skip this step, or if the survivor has no pubic hair, this will be written on the envelope.

For future prosecution, the more detail that can be provided of the survivor’s physical state and of the event, the better.

*   *   1.  **Genital Swabs**

Swabs on the outside of the vagina or the outside of the penis area may pick up secretion samples or DNA evidence.

**Slides must dry for a minimum of one hour to remain viable over time.**

It is likely and completely understandable that the survivor will become uncomfortable during this stage of the process.

As an advocate, you can navigate the consent process, assure them that it will be okay and support them and help the process be as gentle as possible.

*   *   1.  **Anal Swabs**

Swabs taken from the anus and around the rectal region may make survivors extremely uncomfortable.

**They may be very clear that nothing happened during the assault in this area and feel that their sexual practices are being questioned.**

It can help to share that because the body is curved and liquids run, taking samples from this area is a normal part of the process for all survivors.

For this reason, the healthcare provider will take samples from a wide area.

*   *   1.  **Internal Exam**

A physician will likely need to administer an internal exam to ensure there are no injuries.

**This is a very sensitive part of the process, and it is important to remember that the steps of an internal exam can feel, to the survivor, like a repeat of the sexual assault.**

Do your best to work with the survivor and the healthcare provider to navigate the strong feelings that will likely come up.

Ensure that consent is given and maintained at each step of the process, and support the survivor using the communications skills you have learned.

*   *   1.  **What Happens to the Evidence?**

If the equipment is available, the health center may be able to do the blood work themselves rather than sending the survivor’s blood samples outside for testing.

**It is extremely important that all swabs are transferred to clearly labelled slides, which dry for at least one hour prior to packaging.**

In this way, the slides will remain viable as evidence over time.

The final step of the forensic exam is to package everything up in the kit and to use red stickers to close the box up as official evidence.

If there are materials, such as clothing, that do not fit into the box provided, use the same red stickers to create a seal around the bag that holds those materials.

The stickers indicate that the evidence has been sealed and at this point, the chain of evidence now passes to the healthcare center, who will have their own procedure for what happens next.

The stickers create what is called an “integrity seal,” which the healthcare provider will sign with their initials and the date of collection.

**The health center may have secure storage for the kits, until the police come to claim the kit as evidence if a police report is filed.**

**It is important for you to know and to communicate to the survivor how long the evidence will be stored at the health center, and how long the police will store it for, as this may play a part in determining when they decide to prosecute.**

*   1.  **Payment at the Health Center**

In many cases, a survivor is not able to pay for medical treatment for sexual assault.

**Because sexual assault is a crime, many health centers do not charge survivors for receiving treatment.**

In cases where survivors may have health insurance, they may not want the health center visit to show up on their insurance record.

Some governments have compensation funds that cover the cost of the forensic exam, medical treatment, counseling and travel to court, among other expenses, but many of these funds are only available if the survivor files a police report.

It is helpful to understand the situation at the health center you are volunteering at, as if the survivor is required to pay, this may be something you or your organization can support with in different ways.

*   1.  **Evidence Kit Instructions for Healthcare Providers**

If you are working with healthcare providers who have not been trained in sexual assault evidence collection, they may still be willing to collect evidence in a medical exam.

The following are the standardized directions for evidence collection from sexual assault patients.

**While healthcare providers may need to reference these instructions on your device, it is best if they access this information on their own device, if possible.**

This will help to instill a sense of autonomy and self-directed learning on the part of the provider and help prevent you from crossing any sensitive boundaries.

**PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU AND THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER HAVE READ THE DIRECTIONS COMPLETELY PRIOR TO BEGINNING THE EXAM.**

**IF YOU ARE RESPONDING TO CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE, READ SECTION “RESPONDING TO CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE” FIRST!**

**IF PATIENT NEEDS TO URINATE AND DRUG FACILITATED RAPE IS SUSPECTED, READ SECTION “PATIENT ASSESSMENT AND URINE COLLECTION.”**

As this section is written for healthcare providers, you will notice a shift in tone and vocabulary.

*   *   1.  **Pre-Exam Considerations**

**_1\. Priority_**: should be given to examine the sexual assault patient.

Initially, triage the patient for medical needs, safety, and comfort before proceeding with the forensic exam.

**Medical stability is the priority; the sexual assault exam is secondary to any necessary medical response.**

Please note that medical stability is an on-going process during the sexual assault exam.

**2. _Advocate:_ **Call your local advocacy program to provide the patient with a support person to be present during the forensic interview and exam.

**The advocate’s role is essential during this procedure.**

The trained advocate can help with referrals, case management, long-term recovery and psychological healing of the patient.

If you are responding to a patient who came from a facility, do not use an employee of the facility as an advocate.

**3\. _Consent_:** After reading these instructions, explain the forensic examination to the patient and obtain consent for the following specific procedures allowing the patient to decide what procedures they will allow:

_- Full (evidence collection and medical treatment) or limited (medical treatment) exam_

_- Documentation of injury, which may include photography and colposcope- Pregnancy testing, STI Prophylaxis, and Emergency Contraception- Urine collection for Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault_

_- Release of evidence and/or reporting to law enforcement- Referral to child safe house and/or appropriate pediatric medical agency for age appropriate patients_

**The patient is under no obligation to report the assault to the police or to undergo the sexual assault exam.**

**Counsel the patient that collection of evidence is recommended even if they do not think that they want to press charges.**

Ensure that the patient realizes that preservation of evidence is time sensitive and that now is the optimal time to collect.

In the event the patient wants evidence collected, but at the time of the exam does not wish to have the case investigated by law enforcement, it is important to inform the patient how any collected evidence will be stored.

It is often the case that for crime labs to accept evidence, an information report must be filed with the appropriate law enforcement agency responsible for transferring the evidence.

The information report will include, at minimum, the patient’s name, date of birth, and most likely a reference to sexual assault.

**Like all police reports, the information report is public record.**

**The patient is under no obligation to speak to law enforcement at the time of the exam or participate in an investigation.**

**The information report does not automatically result in an active investigation, but rather facilitates the transfer and storage of evidence.**

If the patient decides to pursue an active investigation, they must contact the appropriate law enforcement agency to initiate the investigation. The advocate may be able to help the patient with initiating the investigation.

**If the patient decides against evidence collection, a limited exam can be offered.**

A limited exam includes medications for STI prophylaxis and Emergency Contraception and you would not need a Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit.

**With patient consent, pregnancy testing with subsequent emergency contraception and STD prophylaxis may be provided.**

**The patient still has the option to return within 5 days post assault for a full sexual assault evidence exam.**

If the patient wants to file a police report, notify law enforcement.

**The advocate should remain with the patient during the investigative interview with police.**

As part of the informed consent process, and before sample collection, survivors should be informed of:

_- The purpose of collecting samples for the kit by the medical examiner_

_- How the kit may be used in the investigative process by the survivor’s legal counsel or law enforcement_

_- Processes and associated time frames for testing kits by law enforcement_

_- Survivor notification of kit testing results (e.g. DNA) by law enforcement_

**4\. Exam Payment**

**Inform the patient if the evidence collection portion of the exam will be paid in full by the government, and which portions of treatment, if any, are covered.**

If additional medical treatment charges are incurred, inform the patient that they may be held responsible for the medical portion of the charges (injury repair, prescriptions, etc).

If the patient may apply for additional funding to cover the medical treatment from a fund or commission, inform them that this is available if a police report is filed.

The advocate will likely have contact information for the fund or commission, if one exists in your area.

**5\. Chain of Custody — READ! IMPORTANT!**

**Chain of custody refers to the examiner’s ability to testify under oath that the evidence could not have been tampered or compromised in any way during its collection, packaging, storage or transfer.**

**Chain of Custody must be maintained at all times once the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit is opened.**

**This means the examiner must stay with the evidence collected during the exam until all evidence has been properly sealed and secured.**

Chain of Custody includes an Integrity Seal, which is the assurance that the examiner is responsible for collecting and packaging the evidence.

**The Integrity Seal is the examiner’s initials and the date of collection written over the taped seal of the Evidence Kit’s small and large White Envelopes and large Brown Bag.**

**Once sealed, evidence should be signed over to law enforcement.**

If this is not possible, evidence may be signed over to the next shift at your medical facility. The next individual must take full responsibility for the evidence until law enforcement is able to retrieve the Evidence Kit’s White Envelope and Brown Bag.

**Every individual who assumes responsibility for any evidence must document the handling and transfer of that evidence.**

It is acceptable to keep the kit in an area that is locked securely.

Ideally, law enforcement should obtain the completed kit as soon as possible following the exam.

*   *   *   1.  **Sexual Assault History Form**

Obtain history of assault and relevant data as directed by the enclosed Sexual Assault History Form.

**Complete as much information as possible on the History Form.**

Print clearly and legibly.

When asking the patient to give a description of the assault, DO NOT ASK LEADING QUESTIONS that lead to yes or no answers such as, “Were you raped?”

Instead, ask the patient “What happened?” or “Can you describe the incident to me?”

**Let the patient use their own words and use those words in your charting.**

Documentation of the patient’s account of the assault must be the patient’s verbatim statement. Use quotations to indicate patient’s actual statements.

**It is critical that no re-phrasing occur.**

Let the patient know that for evidence collection you need to ask specific questions about which of the perpetrator’s body parts touched the patient’s body parts.

**This history is for diagnosis and treatment of the patient and to direct the collection of evidence. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL DO THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEW.**

The examiner should avoid using the word “rape” in discussing any conclusions. Use the words “sexual assault” or “assault.”

*   *   *   1.  **Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Exam**

If a Sexual Assault Evidence Kit is available at your health center, obtain one and make sure that it is fully intact.

**If there is not a Sexual Assault Evidence Kit available, you may be able to create one with materials you have at the health center.**

See the section “Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Materials” for what you need to do this.

Read these Sexual Assault Instructions completely prior to starting the sexual assault exam.

Use Personal Protection Equipment (gloves) while collecting evidence to prevent cross-contamination and change gloves frequently during the sexual assault exam.

**The patient’s history is critical in directing the examiner’s collection of evidence.**

Specimens are collected from orifices or sites the patient indicates were involved in the sexual assault.

Exceptions would be pediatrics, drug-facilitated assault, patients with no memory or ability to verbalize the alleged assault, and/or if the examiner observes injuries or other findings.

For these exceptions where the evidence is collected by the examiner but not reported by the patient, write on the outside of that envelope “Collected Not Reported.”

*   *   *   1.  **Exam Room Preparation and Supplies**

**Prepare the room by gathering equipment and supplies so that the exam may be conducted uninterrupted.**

This should include:

_- Speculum_

_- Sterile water_

_- Extra sets of gloves_

_- Blood drawing supplies_

_- Vital sign supplies_

_- Ruler for measuring injuries_

_- Permanent black marker_

_- A stable stand for holding/air-drying the swabs_

_- Clothing for the patient to wear post exam_

Equipment specific for a sexual assault exam includes:

_- Colposcope_

_- Toluidine Blue Dye_

_- Alternative Light Source/Woods Lamp_

_- A camera for photography_

For a list of supplies in the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit, consult the section “Materials” in “Creating Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits.”

**If some supplies are not readily available in the health center, proceed with evidence collection using what you have.**

Open the kit, lay out envelopes that you will use (based on the patient narrative), and label each envelope completely and legibly.

**Label envelopes and bags before placing evidence inside. This minimizes the destruction of evidence and prevents the mix-up of evidence samples.**

Complete the information on the front of the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit White Envelope and Brown Bag.

**Once you have opened the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit, you must maintain Chain of Custody.**

The examiner is responsible for the evidence.

The examiner must stay with the evidence collected during the exam until all evidence has been properly sealed and secured. Evidence is never to be left alone with the patient, family, friend, legal guardian, or advocate. (Refer to the section “Chain of Custody.”)

**Show the patient the room and supplies, and answer any additional patient questions.**

**Encourage the patient to have a person of their choice in the exam room to support them during the process.**

This may be the trained advocate or a friend/family member.

*   *   1.  **Exam Steps**

These are the instructions for the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit.

The items in a Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit are in the section, “Materials” in “Creating Sexual Assault Evidence Kits” and can be pre-made for health centers by advocates or their organization.

*   *   *   1.  **Responding to Child Sexual Abuse**

**If the patient is under the age of eighteen years and there is a suspicion of child sexual abuse by a caregiver, family member or person in authority, your government’s child protective services must be contacted.**

**Not reporting suspected child abuse and neglect, including sexual abuse, is a crime.**

When filing the report, inform the authorities if the alleged perpetrator has continued access to the child.

**A physician does not need the permission of a parent to collect evidence from a child who has been sexually abused.**

Evidence in sexual crimes is considered “fleeting” and thus does not require a search warrant. The child is considered the “crime scene.”

A parent or guardian can be charged with aiding and abetting an alleged perpetrator by not allowing the exam.

The primary differences in using this Sexual Assault Evidence Kit with cases of suspected Child Sexual Abuse are:

_- The window for evidence collection is up to 72 hours while for adolescents/adults, the window is up to 5 days._

_- The examiner does not treat for sexually transmitted infections._

_Sexually transmitted infections are evidence of the crime of sexual abuse. Cultures must be obtained prior to treatment with antibiotics._

_- The examiner does not need to take a Blood Standard for patients under 13 years of age._

_Instead, the examiner should first take the appropriate Oral Swabs if oral penetration is suspected. Then, have the child rinse their mouth thoroughly. Clearly mark a Miscellaneous envelope with the patient’s name and “Buccal Standard.”_

_Lastly, the examiner takes one swab to wipe the inside, fleshy part of the cheek. Use the entire surface of the cotton tip swab to maximize the amount of the child’s buccal saliva obtained. Place the swab in a stable stand and let air-dry before placing it in the pre-labeled envelope._

_- The examiner will not insert a speculum exam on a pre-pubescent child._

_- The examiner should ask the child where secretions may have been left on their body and then swab those areas. The folds and creases in the child’s vulvar area may be wiped with swabs to collect evidence if indicated._

_- Photographs are critical documentation of a child’s injuries._

_- In documenting the history in the History Form, the examiner must use the child’s direct quotes rather than the examiner’s interpretation of the child’s statement._

For more information, consult “A National Protocol for Sexual Abuse Medical Forensic Examinations — Pediatric” (April 2016) at [https://www.justice.gov/ovw/file/846856/download](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/file/846856/download).

*   *   *   1.  **Clothing and Patient Disrobing**

**The patient is under no obligation to forfeit their clothing for evidence. This is entirely the patient’s decision.**

Advise the patient that they may not receive clothing back and if it is returned, it will likely be damaged from lab tests. Explain to the patient that body fluids, hair, and/or trace fibers found on the clothing may contain critical information. 

Even if the patient has changed clothing, it may be useful to collect the underwear worn to the exam, as the underwear may contain drainage from post-assault. 

Inspect clothing for any tears, stains, and debris and document condition of clothing on the History Form. Be careful not to lose any trace fibers from the clothing.

**Photographs of torn or bloodied clothing can support documentation.**

Wet clothing may need to be temporarily laid out for drying and packaging. This must occur in a secured area. Document this in your charting. 

Place two large sheets of paper on the floor, one on top of the other. The bottom sheet keeps the top sheet clean. The bottom sheet will be thrown away while the top sheet and any debris and/or trace fibers will be saved in the pre-labeled Floor Sheet bag.

**Do not use plastic sheeting. **

**Have the patient remove their shoes prior to having them disrobe.**

While standing barefoot on the Floor Sheet, the patient can disrobe and drop clothes gently in the middle of the Floor Sheet. These will be the clothes collected for evidence.

**If the patient declines submitting their clothes for evidence, have the patient lightly shake their clothes over the Floor Sheet for any potential trace fibers and lay the clothes aside. Allow patient to determine what pieces of clothing will be left for evidence. **

Give the patient a hospital gown to wear during the subsequent exam.

**The health center or the advocate should provide the patient with a set of clothing to wear home after discharge.**

*   *   *   1.  **Patient Assessment and Urine Collection**

Obtain the patient’s vital signs.

If abnormal, recheck and take appropriate action.

Injuries causing pain or serious discomfort should be treated before starting the sexual assault exam.

**If a drug-facilitated rape is suspected, urine needs to be collected and preserved.**

Urine may be collected up to 96 hours post-assault. Have the patient urinate into a tamper-resistant, urine specimen container or cup that can be securely sealed. Label the container with the patient’s information.

Obtain a urine specimen for pregnancy test on all female patients of childbearing age. If the specific gravity of the urine is &lt;1.015, a serum pregnancy test should be sent to the lab to assure accurate results.

Perform a head-to-toe assessment for evidence of trauma to the body and investigate any complaints of pain, working your way literally from “head to toe.”

**Pay attention to any area of concern based on the mechanism of injury and the patient’s history of assault.**

Document all injuries.

Measure and describe all injuries indicating location of the injuries.

Use the Body Map that is part of the Sexual Assault History Form.

If possible, photographic documentation of injuries is strongly recommended.

*   *   *   1.  **Blood Standard**

Draw a blood specimen, approximately 0.5ml, and transfer to pre-labeled card that is in the pre-labeled Blood Standard envelope. Blood stain should be about the size of a nickel or quarter coin.

Allow to air dry. Do not use heat to dry. Dry in a secure place to minimize cross-contamination.

Once dried, place this swatch into the pre-labeled Blood Standard envelope.

*   *   *   1.  **Head Hair Standard**

Pull at least 25 head hairs and place them in the pre-labeled Head Hair Standard envelope.

Pull by hand near the patient’s scalp. Include the root of the hair from different areas on the scalp, such as the front, middle, back, and both sides. Include grey hair.

Be sure to collect various lengths and color samples.

**Hairs must be pulled. Scissors or tweezers damage the hair and the root is needed.**

If head hairs adhere to the examiner’s gloves, place the entire glove in the pre-labeled Head Hair Standard envelope.

*   *   *   1.  **Oral Swabs**

Inspect the oral cavity first, documenting any injuries.

Photograph noted injuries.

If oral penetration is reported and/or suspected, swab the gum line, the margin between gums and cheek, the crevices between teeth, and under the tongue with the cotton swabs provided in the Oral Swabs envelope.

Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected.

Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick.

Place the swabs in a stable stand and let the 4 swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs back into the pre-labeled Oral Swabs envelope.

*   *   *   1.  **Genital Exam**

Place the patient in an appropriate position of comfort, dependent on age, to optimally allow you to visualize and perform the vaginal/rectal/penile examination.

Inspect external genitalia and rectal area for visual signs of trauma.

**Document injuries on the Genital Map of the History Form and photograph injuries before obtaining any swab collection.**

If you are using a Colposcope, injury documentation should be done prior to obtaining any swabs. 

You will want to save the Table Sheet that the patient used on the exam table as evidence.

*   *   *   1.  **Public Hair Combings**

The patient’s pubic hair may contain dried secretions from drainage or ejaculation.

If the pubic hair is matted, representative samples should be cut and packaged separately in a pre-labeled Miscellaneous envelope.

Clearly mark on the Miscellaneous envelope what was collected and from where.

Comb the patient’s pubic hair over the pre-labeled Pubic Hair Combings and Comb envelope so that the hair falls into the opened envelope.

When complete, place comb back into envelope.

**You may ask the patient if they would prefer combing themselves. However, the examiner must observe the combing.**

*   *   *   1.  **Anal Swabs**

If rectal penetration is reported and/or suspected, examine the anal area first.

Examination and evidence collection of the anal area is performed prior to genital because this area can be contaminated when inspecting and collecting vaginal specimens.

Examine the rectal area for injury and document any noted injuries prior to obtaining swabs.

The use of a minimal amount of water-soluble, non-spermicidal lubricant, water or saline during the vaginal and/or rectal exam is acceptable and promotes patient comfort.

Remove any foreign bodies and let air-dry before placing in envelope marked Miscellaneous. Clearly document on the Miscellaneous envelope where the evidence was obtained from.

Obtain swabs of the rectal area with the cotton swabs provided in the envelope marked Anal Swabs.

Indicate on the Anal Swab envelope whether swabs are collected from outer anal folds or from within the orifice. If both situations exist, package in separate envelopes and clearly mark the envelope where evidence was collected.

Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected. If particulate matter/fibers are on the swab, do not remove from the swab.

Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick.

Place the 4 swabs in a stable stand and let the swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs back in the pre-labeled Anal Swabs envelope.

*   *   *   1.  **Vaginal Swabs**

If vaginal penetration is reported and/or suspected, examine the vaginal area for injury.

**Document injuries on the Genital Map of the History Form prior to inserting the speculum.**

The use of a minimal amount of water-soluble, non-spermicidal lubricant, water or saline during the vaginal and/or rectal exam is acceptable and promotes patient comfort.

Insert speculum and inspect for injury or foreign bodies. Document any injury within the vaginal canal.

Colposcope documentation should be done prior to obtaining any swabs.

Remove any foreign bodies and let air-dry before placing in the envelope marked Miscellaneous.

Clearly document on the Miscellaneous envelope where the evidence was obtained from.

Obtain swabs of the vaginal area with the cotton swabs provided in the envelope marked Vaginal Swabs.

Indicate on the Vaginal Swab envelope whether swabs are collected from outer labial folds or from within the orifice. If both situations exist, package in separate envelopes and clearly mark the envelope where evidence was collected.

Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected. If particulate matter/fibers are on the swab, do not remove from the swab.

Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick.

Place the 4 swabs in a stable stand and let the swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs back into the pre-labeled Vaginal Swabs envelope.

*   *   *   1.  **Cervical Swabs**

Examine the cervical area for injury.

**Colposcope documentation should be done prior to obtaining any swabs.**

Obtain swabs of the cervical os with the cotton swabs provided in the envelope marked Cervical Swabs.

Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the sample collected.

Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick.

Place the 4 cervical swabs in a stable stand and let the swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs back into the pre-labeled Cervical Swabs envelope.

*   *   *   1.  **Male Genitalia Swabs**

If the patient is male and, dependent upon patient history, collect penile, scrotum, and/or urethral swabs.

The examiner will swab the primary source of potential foreign DNA. This may include the penile shaft, glans, scrotum, and/or urethral opening.

Re-label the cervical and/or vaginal envelope to read “Penile.” Use the swabs that are in that envelope.

Do one swab at a time. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the sample collected.

Mark the first swab obtained with a black marker/Sharpie on the distal wooden portion of the swab stick.

Place the 4 penile swabs in a stable stand and let the swabs air-dry. Once dried, place all 4 swabs into pre-labeled Male Genitalia Swabs envelope.

*   *   *   1.  **Miscellaneous Evidence**

If there is any other evidence such as blood, dried secretions, loose hairs, material fibers, environmental debris (vegetation, dirt, gravel, glass), and/or tampons, collect, dry, and place in a pre-labeled Miscellaneous envelope.

**Clearly label the envelope to describe where evidence was collected.**

If the patient reports scratching the suspect, swab under the patient’s fingernails with swabs that have been moistened with sterile water.

Use one or two swabs per hand depending upon the amount of visible debris. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected.

Place these swabs in a stable stand and let air-dry. Once dried, place swabs in a pre-labeled Miscellaneous envelope.

If swabs are collected from both hands, package swabs collected from left and right hand in separate pre-labeled envelopes, with clear indication of where evidence was collected.

If the patient reports any contact of bodily fluid, use swabs moistened with sterile water to collect samples from the patient’s body where contact was reported.

**This includes areas where the patient reports being bitten or licked.**

Use one or two swabs per body part that patient reports contact. Use the entire surface of each cotton-tip swab to maximize the amount of sample collected.

**An Alternate Light Source or Woods Lamp may help visualize the body fluid.**

Place these swabs in a stable stand and let air-dry. Once dried, place swabs in a pre-labeled Miscellaneous envelope, indicating where the evidence was collected.

*   *   *   1.  **Other Evidence Collected: Film and/or Urine**

**Do not put urine or film into the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Envelope or Brown Bag.**

Clearly mark urine and film with patient information and transfer it to law enforcement as separate items, along with the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Envelope and Brown Bag.

Law enforcement is responsible for the processing of film.

Law enforcement is responsible for transferring the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Envelope, Brown Bag, Film and/or Urine to their appropriate Crime Lab.

*   1.  **Suggested Medications for Sexual Assault Survivors**

**Preventative medications for emergency contraception and sexually transmitted infections should be offered to adults and for adolescents where child sexual abuse is not suspected.**

**Testing for STI’s in adults/adolescents for sexual assault is not required.**

**Medications should be offered as a prophylactic measure.**

Below is a summary of medications that can be offered for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and Emergency Contraception.

For thorough guidance on STI prevention and the recommended treatment for adolescents and adults, view the Centers for Disease Control webpage at: www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050909.htm.

**Suggested Medications for Sexual Assault Patients for STI Prophylaxis and Emergency Contraception**

Gonorrhea Prophylaxis in Adolescents and Adults (Female and Male)

_- Ciproflaxin (Cipro) 500 mg PO x 1:_ **Do not** administer if the patient is pregnant or nursing.

_- Cefpodoxime Proxetil Vantin 400 mg PO x 1:_ **Administer** if patient is allergic to Cipro. **Safe** if pregnant or nursing.**Administer** if male anally or orally penetrated.

Chlamydia Prophylaxis in Adolescents and Adults (Female and Male)

_- Azithromycin (Zithromax) 1 Gram PO x 1:_ **Do not** administer if patient is allergic to Erythromycin. **Safe** if patient pregnant or nursing.

_- Doxycycline (Vibramycin) 100 mg PO BID for 7 days:_ **Administer** if patient allergic to Zithromax. **Do not** administer if the patient is pregnant or nursing.

_- Amoxicillin 500 mg PO TID x 7 days_: **Administer** if allergic to Erythromycins (Zithromax). **Safe** if patient pregnant or nursing.

Trichomonas Prophylaxis in Adolescents and Adults (Female)

_- Metronidazole (Flagyl) 2 grams PO x 1:_ **Do not** administer if ETOH has been ingested within 24 hours. **Do not** administer this medication if the patient is pregnant or nursing. If pregnant and nursing **no** treatment.

Emergency Contraception in Adolescents and Adults (Female)

_- Levonsorgestrel (Plan B) 2 tablets (0.75 mg each) PO_ before the patient is discharged from the health center. **Do not** give after 5 days (120 hours) of assault. **Do not** give if patient is pregnant. **Safe** if patient nursing. **Must** obtain a urine pregnancy test prior to administering Levonorgestrel.

**Offer** Emergency Contraception even if patient on birth control (Depo, BCP, Patch, Tubal ligation, Post-Menopausal, or Hysterectomy, etc.).

The healthcare facility must inform the patient about emergency contraception and provide the medication if requested by the patient.

Anal Discomfort Treatment in Adolescents and Adults (Female and Male)

_- Docusate Sodium (Colace) 100 mg capsule PO once daily for 7 days_ as a take home medication for patients who have been rectally penetrated.

_- Tucks 1 Pad up to six times daily for 7 days_ as needed for hemorrhoids as a take-home medication. **Do not** administer if allergic to witch-hazel.

*   1.  **Patient Discharge**

Determine where the patient is to be discharged to and make appropriate arrangements for transportation.

Complete discharge instructions and give both verbal and written instructions to the patient.

Work with the volunteer advocate to identify appropriate referrals and resources. Inform the patient concerning community referrals.

*   1.  **Creating Sexual Assault Evidence Kits**

A Sexual Assault Evidence Kit is a package of materials used to collect samples, which are considered evidence, from a survivor’s or perpetrator’s body by a healthcare provider.

**The type of evidence collected depends on what occurred during the assault.**

The contents of the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit include swabs and collection envelopes for biological material, debris and underwear.

**Guided by the case history, sexual assault samples should be collected from any survivor seeking care as soon as possible and up to 5 days or longer post assault.**

Sample collection should be an option for all sexual assault survivors who present for a medical forensic exam, including those who choose not to report or anonymous collection options.

If the health center does not have a Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit available, you or your organization may want to assemble them with locally-available materials.

Once the kits are assembled and given to the health center, they should be treated as any other medical supply.

**Consistent, up-to-date inventory of the Sexual Assault Evidence Collections Kits in the health center will help prevent emergency requests for kits.**

Due to increased sensitivity of DNA technologies, masks and gloves should be used by healthcare providers or other who are in close proximity to the evidence.

*   *   *   1.  Materials

Label the envelopes and ensure all the forms and instructions are clearly printed. Assemble all the materials into a small box and seal the box, marking as detailed below.

*   *   *   1.  Minimum Criteria for a Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit

To ensure that the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits can be admissible as evidence in court, ensure that they have the folowing:

_- Uniform kit packaging (e.g. box, envelope) to increase the efficiency of proper storage, tracking and retrieval_

_- Unique identifier_

_- Discreet labeling to protect survivor privacy_

_- Identification for the type of kit collected (survivor or suspected perpetrator)_

_- Standard medical forensic documents_

_- Standard working and labeling for the sample envelopes_

_- Standard collection terms (such as swabs, envelopes, etc.)_

*   *   *   1.  Law Enforcement Responsibilities for Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits

**Chain of custody is critical to establish the authenticity and relevance of admissible evidence.**

A proper chain of custody document identifies everyone who has had custody of the evidence and tracks the location of that evidence in chronological order from collection to destruction.

**The collection of samples for the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit establishes the first link in the chain of custody.**

**The healthcare provider who has collected the samples needs to record an inventory of each item as part of the forensic exam.**

All personnel who handle evidence should be aware that court testimony may be expected as part of their interaction with the evidence.

Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits should be received by the local law enforcement agency from the health center as soon as possible, ideally no later than 3 business days from the collection of the kit.

**Law enforcement agencies should submit the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit to the laboratory for analysis as soon as possible, ideally no later than 7 business days from the collection of the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit.**

**Law enforcement, prosecutors, courts or laboratories should be responsible for the long terms storage of all Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits, from reported and not reported crimes.**

A comprehensive initial inventory should be conducted to determine the number, status, location and individual descriptive information (e.g. unique kit identifier, survivor identification, date collected) for all Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits.

Law enforcement agencies should perform an annual audit verifying the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits in the property room are present and in their specified location.

**Where possible, law enforcement agencies should implement electronic records management systems to improve case investigations and communications.**

When law enforcement agencies implement electronic evidence management systems, they should develop a mechanism to give survivors near-real time access to key information related to the status of the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit. Survivor notification should be undertaken with care and sensitivity using a survivor-centered and trauma-informed approach.

**All Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits in which the survivor has consented to reporting should be submitted to the laboratory for DNA testing.**

Unreported or anonymous Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits should be retained for at least one year.

Policies for medical-forensic record retention should be created in accordance with statues of limitations and criminal justice records, rather than traditional parameters for medical record keeping, storage, retention and destruction.

*   *   *   1.  Tracking Chain of Custody

The following items can be used as a checklist to track the chain of custody of a Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit:

Chain of Custody:

_- Date/time/identity of individual who collected evidence_

_- Any person(s) in possession of the evidence at scene and during transport_

_- Date/time/identity of person who submitted the evidence_

_- Date/time/identity of property/evidence custodian who accepted or received the evidence_

_- Date/time/identity of any person to whom the evidence was released and from who it was returned._

Unique Item Identification:

_- Description of item_

_- Unique number identifier_

_- Evidence items created from analysis or separated from the original evidence item should be documented to show the linkage between it and the original evidence_

Location of item in property/evidence storage room or other external location(s):

_- Location (e.g. shelf number or bin) where evidence is stored_

_- Date/time/identity of person who stored the evidence_

_- Systems should have the means to identify items or evidence that has not been returned according to agency policy._

*   *   *   1.  Forms to Print

_- Authorization to Release_

_- Evidence Collection and Exam Checklist_

_- Form for Healthcare Providers_

_- Instructions_

_- Medical Chart_

_- Sexual Assault History Form_

_- Supplemental Report Form_

*   1.  **Filing a Police Report**

**The decision to file a police report and follow through with prosecution is a deeply personal decision that rests with the survivor.**

As an advocate, you have an opportunity to collaborate with healthcare providers and the police to prosecute the crime of sexual assault.

This coordinated response sends a message to the community that says that the crime of sexual assault is taken seriously.

**When there are successful prosecutions, community members are more willing to come forward at health centers to disclose sexual assault and begin the process of prosecution.**

**If the survivor is at all considering whether to follow up with prosecution, they must file a police report to document that a crime has been committed.**

**As an advocate, your role is to explain the process to the survivor.**

**They may want to make a statement to law enforcement while at the health center, or they may prefer to do this later.**

Consider whether you would be willing to accompany them to the police station while they make a statement, as part of your advocacy work.

1.  **RESPECT**

**Respect**: Keep everything confidential unless you are concerned that the survivor will harm themselves or others. Always respect the survivor’s wishes with regards to how to handle the situation.

1.  **About Safety Planning**

The current and long-term safety of survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence is a primary concern.

**Most perpetrators of sexual assault and intimate partner violence are not strangers — they are known to the survivor, and may be their partner.**

**Survivors are often legitimately afraid of the risk of further violence or retaliation for seeking medical treatment or reporting to law enforcement.**

This could be violence by the perpetrators themselves, or their friends and families.

If the perpetrator is a stranger and they have not been apprehended by law enforcement, the survivor may be afraid of the threat that they pose to themselves and their family members.

**Advocates need to know how to work with the survivor to create a safety plan for them to follow after they are discharged from the health center.**

**A safety plan is a personalized, practical plan that includes ways to remain safe, cope with emotions, tell friends and family about the assault, take legal action, and more.**

The emotional safety of the survivor is as important to address as their physical safety and should also be addressed.

Creating a safety plan means brainstorming with the survivor about ways for them to stay safe that can help to reduce their risk of future harm. A safety plan is a living thing that needs to change with time, so it is important that the survivor makes it their own and updates it as often as they need to.

Working with a survivor to develop a safety plan requires that you actively listen to the survivor, not only to obtain information, but to find out how the survivor thinks and feels about the situation. Take into account not just their physical safety, but their emotional and digital safety as well.

Address the survivor’s needs from their own perspective, rather than from your own, and get as much input from the survivor as possible.

**It is important for the survivor to find ways to be and feel safe, and safety plans should seek to reduce their risk, never increase it.**

A good safety plan identifies resources to address the survivor’s needs, including decisions about what to do next and planning what to do in case there is a future incident.

Safety plans also connect the survivor with resources and allows them to make their own decisions and how and when to access them. Remember, advocacy is always about the survivor.

1.  **Safety Planning for Intimate Partner Violence**

It is important to note that the primary objective when safety planning with survivors is their safety.

**Many of the tips below will not work for some survivors of intimate partner violence. Please use your discretion and best judgement.**

When you are safety planning with a survivor, you may know if they are living in a situation where there is intimate partner violence that could expose them to further or life-threatening risk.

**For this reason, it is important to screen for intimate partner violence and other forms of abuse.**

Once you have done this, be prepared to share information about resources available in your community that could support the survivor and even help the survivor contact them, if they need you to. (See the section “Building Referral Networks.”)

Ask the following questions to help the survivor develop their safety plan:

_- Where will they go after leaving the health center? Will anyone accompany them? If someone is accompanying them, will they be able to adequately support the survivor? Is there anyone else that the survivor would like to contact?_

_- Does the survivor’s living situation expose them to the threat of continued violence or harassment? Do they need emergency shelter or alternative housing options?_

_- Is the survivor eligible for protective orders from law enforcement?_

_- Does the survivor need additional security measures?_

_- What personal support systems are available, for example family members, friends, faith leaders or others who can provide emotional, financial or physical assistance to the survivor in the following days._

_- If the survivor feels unsafe, what will they do to get help? Discuss the available options with them and help them to develop a plan._

Safety planning must also factor in the needs and concerns of specific populations. For example, if a survivor has physical disabilities, they may not be able to access the local domestic violence shelter or receive the staff support they need for their daily activities.

*   1.  **General Safety Planning for Intimate Partners Violence**

- _Home safety_: If the survivor lives with the perpetrator, they could sleep in a common room, like the living room, or lock the door to their room if it is not shared and if that would not escalate the situation. If the perpetrator does not live with the survivor, the survivor could change the locks to their house, install an outdoor lighting system triggered by motion sensors if that is available, and keep all doors locked when not actively using them.

- _Find safe places nearby_: The community may have a domestic violence shelter, or the survivor may have a friend or family member’s home they can stay at. The survivor can learn where these are located and how to reach them.

- _Create a code word_: The survivor can create and use a code word to alert others that they need help. If they have children, the survivor can use a code word to alert them that they need to leave immediately.

- _Have an excuse ready_: The survivor can create a list of several believable excuses for leaving the house suddenly at different times of the day or night, if the situation becomes dangerous.

- _Stay mindful of digital safety_: Because the perpetrator may be monitoring their computer or phone, the survivor can erase their digital footprint by clearing their cache, history or cookies and hiding or deleting apps. Alternately, they could use a public computer or a friend’s device to obtain safety information and find support.

- _Build a support network_: The survivor can notify trusted friends and family that they are experiencing intimate partner violence and ask them for help responding if there is a crisis.

*   1.  **Physical Safety from Sexual Assault**

When a partner becomes physically violent if the survivor says no to a sexual activity, it may be safer for them to “give in” to protect themselves.

If this happens, it can be helpful to remind survivors that this does not mean that they consented to what happened, or that what happened was their fault or responsibility.

**Making choices to protect someone’s safety, including their own, is survival — not consent.**

**If someone does not feel safe enough to say no, consent is not possible.**

It can be helpful to remind the survivor that everyone deserves a partner who treats them with respect at all times.

Here are some ideas around safety planning for survivors of intimate partner violence if the survivor does not live with their partner:

_- Try to only spend time with the partner in public_

_- Take a friend along when visiting the partner_

_- Avoid seeing the partner in places or at times of day when sexual abuse generally occurs_

Here are some ideas around safety planning for survivors of intimate partner violence if the survivor lives with their partner:

_- Stay at a friend or family member’s house, or in a different room_

_- Tell the partner they have business or a family emergency and that they need to go out of town_

_- After bedtime, ask family and friends to call them and pretend there is a minor emergency that requires the survivor to be with them_

_- Fake an illness such as a urinary tract infection, yeast infection or something else that prohibits the survivor from having sex_

Whether the survivor decides to use strategies to avoid sexual activity or not will not change whether their partner is abusive.

**If someone choses to be abusive, no one else can prevent them from being abusive.**

*   1.  **Leaving a Relationship with Intimate Partner Violence**

**- _IMPORTANT_: If the survivor is in immediate physical danger, they should go directly to the police or to a shelter, if one is available in your community.**

**In some areas, the police may not be a safe place, so please use your best judgement if this is true in your context.**

- _Pack an escape bag_: The survivor can pack and hide a bag that includes their important legal and other documents (for example, government identification, legal documents, medical records, prescriptions, bills, etc.). If the survivor has children, their important documents should be included as well.

The bag should include money, keys, clothes, toiletries and other necessary items to take with them if they need to leave urgently. If the bag is found, the survivor can claim it is for earthquakes, fires or other natural disaster emergencies.

- _Plan where to go_: The survivor should have a plan in place for where to go, whether it is staying with trusted friends and family or a local domestic violence shelter.

- _Plan how to get there_: The survivor should plan how to reach where they plan to go, and plan an alternate direction and method of reaching the place. If they have their own transport, they should plan to keep the petrol tank full. If they plan to take public transport, they should know the routes and departure times. This information may be available online or via app, depending on your area.

- _Communicate their plan to others_: The survivor can inform trusted friends and family of the situation and keep them updated of their plans. The survivor can direct trusted friends and family how to respond if the perpetrator contacts them.

*   1.  **Stalking**

When safety planning in situations with a stalker, it is helpful to know that the average stalking case lasts approximately two years.

**Safety planning begins when the survivor identifies the behavior as stalking and needs to evolve as the situation continues.**

- _Reach out_: The survivor can tell trusted friends and family what is happening and visit local law enforcement to determine what steps can be taken to protect themselves.

The survivor can give a photo of the stalker to family, friends and colleagues. Supervisors have a responsibility to keep the survivor safe at work.

- _Stay connected_: The survivor can keep their phone charged and topped up with credit. They could also put emergency numbers on speed dial, saved under a different name to disguise them, or even memorize these numbers in case they are not able to access their own phone.

- _Avoid routines_: The survivor can find different ways to reach their regular destinations, including taking different methods of transport or changing the roads they use.

- _Avoid traveling alone_: The survivor can enlist the help of trusted friends and family to accompany them outside the home or work environment whenever possible.

- _Collect evidence_: It can be helpful to gather information about the stalker, if it is known to the survivor. The survivor can save threatening phone messages, texts, emails or any other evidence to present to law enforcement when making a case for a protective order against the stalker.

**It is important for the survivor to log all stalking behavior, including attempts to contact them directly.**

- _Plan what to do when in danger_: If the survivor is in immediate danger, they should have a plan of safe spaces to locate, including a police station, family or friends’ houses, domestic violence shelters, places of worship or safe public areas.

*   1.  **Assessing Mortal Danger**

In situations of severe abuse, survivors of intimate partner violence may be at risk of being killed by an intimate partner.

**The following questions can help a survivor be aware of the danger of homicide and recognize how many of the risk factors apply to their situation.**

_Part 1: Calendar_

Using a print-out calendar of the past year, ask the survivor to mark the approximate dates when they were beaten by their partner.

On that date, ask them to rate how severe the incident was using the following scale.

**If any of the descriptions for a higher number apply, ask the survivor to use the higher number.**

_1\. Slapping, pushing; no injuries and/or lasting pain_

_2\. Punching, kicking; bruises, cuts and/or continuing pain_

_3\. “Beating up;” severe contusions, burns, broken bones_

_4\. Threat to use weapon; head injury, internal injury, permanent injury_

_5\. Use of weapon; wounds from weapon_

_Part 2: Yes or No Questions_

Ask the survivor to mark a yes or no for each of the following questions about their partner.

_1\. Has the physical violence increased in frequency over the past year?_

_2\. Has the physical violence increased in severity over the past year and/or has a weapon or threat from a weapon ever been used?_

_3\. Does your partner ever try to choke you?_

_4\. Is there a weapon in the house?_

_5\. Has your partner ever forced you to have sex when you did not want to?_

_6\. Does your partner use drugs?_

_7\. Does your partner threaten to kill you and/or do you believe that your partner is capable of killing you?_

_8\. Is your partner drunk every day or almost every day, in terms of quantity of alcohol?_

_9\. Does your partner control most or all of your daily activities? For example, does your partner tell you who you can be friends with, how much money you can take with you shopping, or when you can leave the house? If you partner tries, but you do not let them, please answer “yes.”_

_10\. For Women: Have you ever been beaten by your partner while you were pregnant?_

_11\. Is your partner violently and constantly jealous of you? For example, do they say, “If I can’t have you, no one can?”_

_12\. Have you ever threatened or tried to commit suicide?_

_13\. Has your partner ever threatened or tried to commit suicide?_

_14\. If the Survivor has Children: Is your partner violent towards your children?_

_15\. Is your partner violent outside of the home?_

Have the survivor add up the total number of “yes” answers.

**Communicate to the survivor that the more “yes” answers they have, the greater their risk of homicide from intimate partner violence.**

Please refer the survivor to resources for intimate partner violence in your community, if they exist.

1.  **How to Safety Plan**

Although no safety plan can ensure that a survivor will not face violence again, the goal of safety planning is to help survivors be as safe as possible given their circumstances.

**A good safety plan empowers the survivor to reclaim a sense of safety and security by addressing their immediate safety needs and it outlines strategies to help reduce the risk of future incidents.**

Be prepared to share information about resources available in your community that could support the survivor and to help the survivor to contact them, if needed. See the section “Building Referral Networks” for more.

**It is essential that law enforcement’s investigative procedures do not compromise the safety plan or safety strategy of the survivor.**

If the survivor involves law enforcement who are present at the health center, work respectfully with them to keep the safety of the survivor their first priority.

As you move through the sections in this module, use your judgement on what questions are relevant to explore and which are not, given what you know about the survivor’s experiences.

**Remember that the survivor may not have or want to share answers to all the questions that you chose to explore.**

The following is a list of topic areas and questions to explore.

**Not all topics will apply in every situation, so keep in mind what is relevant. Avoid overwhelming the survivor.**

Please note that if you are safety planning with a sexual assault survivor under the age of 18, minors access to resources explored below may be limited. In general, minors do not have the same rights and adults and, depending on your country, there may be laws that mandate reporting and their rights to privacy and consent.

**The following information is for survivors of sexual assault by a non-intimate partner, in which there is often a lack of personal information about the perpetrator, as well as different legal protections, risks and resources for the survivor.**

If needed, see the “Safety Planning for Intimate Partner Violence” section for more information.

It is important to maintain an up-to-date referral list of resources to support survivors, an area we will cover in the “Referrals” module.

If you feel unqualified to discuss these issues or you feel it is inappropriate for you to do so, refer the survivor to a counselor in your community who specializes in supporting survivors of sexual assault.

*   1.  **Privacy and Confidentiality**

**Before you begin safety planning, it is essential to discuss privacy and confidentiality issues with the survivor.**

**Unlike lawyers, counselors, or other licensed professionals, advocate records are not protected by absolute privilege, so you need to be aware that your records could potentially be used against the survivor in court.**

Records such as safety planning notes regarding the survivor’s mental health, contact with the perpetrator, other disclosures or even personal testimony based on verbal conversation could be used as evidence in a civil or criminal case.

**It is important to make sure that your notes and records do not reveal anything identifying, damaging or incrimination about the survivor.**

Balance your need for information with the risk of hard to the survivor, considering how that information could be used against the survivor if it was brought up in court.

**Your first priority as an advocate safety planning with a survivor of sexual assault is to safeguard their privacy, even if that means that certain resources are no longer an option.**

Before you decide to ask the survivor about suicidal thoughts or other forms of self-harm, you must discuss your reporting obligations. They must make an informed decision whether to disclose, because if they do so, you may be legally obligated to share that information with the health center.

*   1.  **Using Appropriate Language**

If the survivor is not able to converse in your language, see if the health center can provide an interpreter who is not known to the survivor.

If possible, the interpreter should be trained in working in sexual assault-related issues that require comfort using vocabulary around sexual violence, including informal terms.

**A survivor’s family members or friends should never be called upon to act as interpreters because of confidentiality and safety issues.**

**If no interpreter is available at the health center, one may be available to assist by phone or online.**

**When safety planning with the survivor, be conscious of using gendered pronouns and of making gendered assumptions.**

For example:

_- Not all survivors are female_

_- Not all perpetrators are male_

_- Not all survivors are assaulted by members of the opposite sex_

_- Not all survivors of same-sex assault identify as LGBTQIA_

_- Some survivors may wish to be referred to using a pronoun that is different than their birth gender_

**If in doubt, it is always best to ask the survivor what they prefer.**

*   1.  **Holistic Safety**

**The emotional safety of the survivor is as important to address as their physical safety.**

After sexual assault, many survivors turn to harmful coping mechanisms like additions including substance abuse, eating disorders, cutting or self-mutilation.

**Survivors may also show increased risk-taking or other high-risk behaviors.**

**It is common for survivors to experience trauma-induced mental health conditions including suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress.**

Survivors may feel unsafe in their own bodies and isolate themselves from friends, family and public life.

Healing from sexual assault is a process that can take many years.

Safety planning is an ongoing process. Over time, contexts change and new concerns can arise that require the safety plan to change as well.

For many survivors, their emotional, mental, physical and economic safety will be an issue for an extended time after the assault.

For this reason, it is important that survivors understand that their safety plan will also need to change.

1.  **Areas to Explore**

A good way to start safety planning with the survivor is to ask them about their safety concerns and what they need to keep themselves safe.

You can then explore options with them so that they determine what works best for their situation.

It can help to give an overview of the different areas of safety planning and then ask the survivor which ones they want to talk about.

**The sample questions below will not be appropriate for all survivors and are intended as a guide only.**

There will be elements of safety planning that we have not included, so we encourage you to use your judgement and create additional questions that may be appropriate to the survivor’s needs.

**Use these questions as a discussion guide, rather than a checklist.**

Try to avoid asking questions that are not relevant to the survivor’s context.

*   1.  **Physical Safety**

Discussion questions for physical safety planning include:

_- Does the survivor have a mobile phone that they can use to call for help? Who will they plan to call?_

_- Does the survivor have a plan in case of emergencies? For example, who will they call, where will they go and how will they get there?_

_- Are the specific things the survivor can do to make themselves feel safer?_

_- Has the perpetrator contacted the survivor after the assault?_

_- How and where might the survivor encounter the perpetrator?_

_- Is the survivor concerned about the perpetrator’s family or friends?_

_- Does the survivor see the perpetrator when they are in public? If so, where?_

_- Is there a trusted friend or family member who could accompany the survivor to places where they need to go?_

_- If the survivor was approached by the perpetrator in a public place, do they know where they could go to be safe?_

_- Has the perpetrator threatened them, directly or indirectly?_

_Threats can include telling other people about the assault, threatening that the survivor will lose their job, threatening to tell others about their gender identity or sexual orientation, or threatening to post photos or statements online._

_- Does the perpetrator have any information about where the survivor lives, works, attends school, or other places the survivor goes to regularly?_

_- Has the perpetrator stalked the survivor, their friends or family?_

_- Is the survivor considering reporting the assault to law enforcement? Do they have any questions about the reporting process?_

_- Does the survivor have any type of protection order against the perpetrator? If not, do they think such an order would be helpful? For example, some countries have what is called a civil protection order that can be useful, but it may only be available in cases of intimate partner violence or if the survivor has personal information about the perpetrator, such as their name and address._

_- Are there specific things that the survivor could do to help them feel safer in their community?_

*   1.  **Digital Safety**

Discussion questions for digital safety planning include:

**1\. Digital Privacy**

_- Does the perpetrator know the survivor’s phone number or email address? Do they know any of the survivor’s passwords?_

_- Has the survivor reviewed their privacy settings on computers, social media sites, and apps since the assault? Do they know how to adjust those settings to keep their information, including their location, more secure?_

_- Does the survivor know how to turn off geolocation services on their computer, phone and apps?_

_- Has the survivor searched for their name online? If so, does any private information, including their address or phone number, show up? If so, do they know how to remove this information?_

**2\. Safe Web Browsing**

_- Does the survivor know how to use private browsing to visit websites without storing records of their activity on their device?_

_- Does the survivor know how to clear their cache, history and cookies? This can erase records of their activity, although if someone is actively monitoring them it can also alert them to the fact that the survivor is trying to conceal their actions, which could be dangerous._

_- If their own devices are not considered safe, can the survivor use a public computer or a friend’s device to access the online information they need?_

_- Does the survivor have reason to believe they may have spyware on their computer? Do they know how to find out and remove it?_

**3\. Safer Social Media**

_- Does the survivor have a social media account, for example Facebook or LinkedIn? If so, are they friends with the perpetrator? Are any of their friends? Do they know how to block the perpetrator and the perpetrator’s contacts from accessing them through social media?_

_- Has the perpetrator, their friends or family contacted the survivor using social media? If so, can they save and keep the evidence?_

_- Has the perpetrator, their friends or family posted anything about the survivor online? What was posted? Is it still online? Can the survivor save and keep it as evidence?_

*   1.  **At Home**

Discussion questions for safety planning at home include:

_- What kind of housing does the survivor live in? Do they live alone or in shared housing? Do they know the people who may share their housing?_

_- Does the perpetrator have access to the survivor’s housing?_

_- Is the survivor physically safe in their housing? Do their windows and doors lock? Do they have lights outside of their home?_

_- Does the survivor have trusted friends or family nearby where they could stay if they needed to leave their housing? How could the survivor contact them?_

_- Does the survivor feel the need to move to new housing? Is it possible to do so? Do they need assistance with finding new housing?_

_- What could the survivor do to feel safer in their housing?_

*   1.  **At School**

Discussion questions for safety planning at school include:

_- Does the survivor feel safe at school or on campus?_

_- Does the perpetrator know where the survivor attends school? Does the perpetrator know their class schedule?_

_- Is the perpetrator a student at their school or in a position of authority at their school?_

_- Has the survivor told anyone at their school about the assault? Do they want to continue attending their current school?_

_- Are there things that the survivor or others could do that would make them feel safer on campus?_

*   1.  **At the Workplace**

Discussion questions for safety planning at the workplace include:

_- Is the survivor currently employed? If so, does the perpetrator know where they work?_

_- Is the perpetrator a colleague or someone who has authority over them at work?_

_- Does anyone at the survivor’s workplace know about the assault?_

_- Is there a sexual harassment policy at the survivor’s workplace?_

_- Did the survivor tell their employer about the assault? If so, how did they respond? If they have not reported the assault to their employer, does the survivor think that doing so would make them safer?_

_- Does the survivor encounter the perpetrator at work? Are there steps the survivor can take to avoid interacting with the perpetrator? What else can the survivor do to increase their safety at work?_

_- Does the survivor want to continue working at their current job? Is moving to other locations, shifts or teams an option?_

*   1.  **Using Transportation**

Discussion questions for safety planning when using transportation include:

_- How does the survivor travel to places where they need to be? For example, work, school, shopping, religious services, friends and family’s houses._

_- Does the perpetrator know the routes that the survivor takes to travel places? If so, can the survivor change these routes?_

_- Does the survivor have access to public transportation? Do they feel comfortable using it?_

_- Does the perpetrator use the same public transportation as the survivor? If so, are there other transportation methods that the survivor could use?_

_- Are there specific actions the survivor could take to help them feel safer when they travel?_

*   1.  **Vulnerable Communities**

A survivor from a marginalized or vulnerable community will have distinct safety planning needs.

You will want to explore specific safety concerns when working with survivors from the following communities:

_- LGBTQIA_

_- People of color_

_- Indigenous people_

_- Not citizens of the country you are in_

_- Immigrants or refugees_

_- Physically or cognitively disabled_

_- Elderly_

_- Children under 18_

_- Homeless_

_- Trafficked or sexually exploited_

_- Military service members_

1.  **Follow-Up**

When the survivor is ready to leave the health center, there are several options that may be appropriate for follow up:

1\. Was the survivor given discharge instructions, including instructions on medication to take? Do they have the medication already or need help getting it? Do they understand the instructions they’ve been given about how to take their medication?

2\. Does the survivor need to return to the health center for any tests or treatment? If so, would they like you to accompany them?

3\. Would the survivor like you to check in with them in a few days or a week, to see how they are doing? Oftentimes, survivors realize the impact of sexual assault days or weeks later, so it may be helpful to know that they can contact you for support or referrals.

4\. If the perpetrator has been arrested, is there a way that they can be notified if the perpetrator is released for any reason, for example if they post bail? This is often called jail notification and it may be available in your area.

5\. Have you provided the survivor with information about support services, including legal support and crisis counseling, available in your community? For example, if victim’s compensation is available, do they know how to apply for it? See the section on Referrals for more.

Many advocates make themselves available only for health center advocacy, but others work to create a longer-term support network for survivors that accompanies them on their healing journey, however long the process. It is up to you if you chose to do this.

**It is important that the survivor know that by coming to the health center, they took an important first step in self-care but that they will need to be patient and compassionate with themselves as they begin the process of physical and emotional healing.**

It can be very helpful to makes plans to check in with the survivor because it may take some time for their feelings to process and come to the surface.

It is very normal for them to think that in the moment, the assault is not bothering them and that they can put it behind them.

*   1.  **Self-care after Trauma**

Before the survivor leaves the health center, it is valuable to speak with them about self-care in the days and weeks to come.

**Self-care is about taking steps to feel healthy and comfortable, and can help the survivor to cope with the short- and long-term effects of trauma from sexual assault.**

After experiencing trauma, it is important for the survivor to make a plan to and take steps to keep their body healthy and strong. They may be healing from injuries or feel emotionally exhausted. Healthy behaviors can support them during this time.

Self-care practices are different for everyone, so encourage the survivor to explore what works for them.

*   1.  **Physical Self-care**

When planning for the physical self-care of the survivor, encourage them to think about a time when they felt physically healthy and ask them:

_- At that time, how were they sleeping? Did they have a sleep ritual or a nap pattern that made them feel more rested?_

_- What kind of food were they eating? What meals made them feel healthy and strong?_

_- What kind of exercise did they enjoy? Were there particular activities that made them feel more energized?_

_- Did they have certain routines to start and end the day that made them feel good?_

Helping the survivor to remember these and decide to pursue these behaviors can help them cope with the intense emotions and after-effects of trauma.

*   1.  **Emotional Self-care**

When planning for the emotional self-care of the survivor, encourage them to think about a time when they felt emotionally balanced and ask them:

_- What activities did they do at that time for fun or to relax? What did they enjoy? Were there events or activities that they looked forward to?_

_- Where did they spend their time? Was there a place or environment that helped them to feel comfortable?_

_- Did they spend time with people who made them feel safe and supported? Who were they?_

_- Did they write down their thoughts in a journal or personal notebook?_

_- Did they practice meditation or other relaxation activities as part of their daily routine?_

_- Was there an author or website that they enjoyed reading for inspiration?_

*   1.  **Advocate Debriefing**

If you are volunteering as an advocate as part of an organization, you will already have a built-in support structure for your work that it is important you take advantage of.

**If a survivor’s case is particularly challenging, it is important to debrief with a supervisor. This is true especially if you have concerns about how you handled your advocacy.**

It is common for advocates to avoid reaching out for support because they think that their supervisor or other colleagues who could support do not want to, when in fact they are eager to help their volunteers.

**If you are an advocate volunteering with an informal network of other advocates, consider creating a peer support group so that volunteers can debrief after particularly difficult cases.**

Monthly peer support groups are opportunities for volunteers to talk about difficult cases and share best practices and lessons learned.

Both debriefing and sharing in peer support groups can be done while maintaining the survivor’s privacy and confidentiality.

**When advocates share about their experiences they are less likely to experience stress-related conditions and move likely to remain engaged and committed to their work.**

1.  **Referrals**
    1.  **Building Referral Networks**

It is useful to be able to connect the survivor to other support services that they can access.

**You will need to develop a referral network of agencies or organizations that can appropriately address survivors’ needs.**

Talk directly to the providers in your network to learn more about the services they offer.

**Ask them for information so that you can inform a survivor about their services.**

Keep your referral network list up-to-date and accurate, as organizations and their contact points often change.

The following are agencies or organizations you may want to include in your referral network:

_- Sexual violence shelters or rape crisis centers_

_- Groups that can provide legal and financial relocation assistance_

_- Taxi or private car transport services_

_- Support groups for survivors of sexual assault or intimate partner violence_

_- Mental health specialists such as therapists or counselors, including addiction specialists_

_- Healthcare providers_

_- Law enforcement_

**Depending on the area or community where you work, some or all these resources may not be available.**

If you live in a rural area, the closest available services may be in the nearest urban area.

**Before making a referral, you must explain to the survivor about any confidentiality issue or mandated reporting that the service provider may have.**

For example, if you are referring a survivor under the age of 18 to a counselor, they will likely be required by law to report the assault to law enforcement, depending on the country you are in.

*   1.  **Making Referrals**

It can be helpful to provide a survivor with a list of referral agencies and organizations that includes information about each of them.

**Be sure that the information you provide includes contact information, including a phone number, email address, website and a physical address, as well as when they are open.**

**Advise the survivor if they need to bring any documentation with them and what kind of service and payment for services they should expect.**

If there are any eligibility criteria that the survivor must have to access these services, make that clear in the material as well.

Review this information with the survivor so that they can decide if they want to access these services.

Sometimes when you make referrals, there can be problems such as:

_- The referral agency or organization is not available for a particular service_

_- The referral agency or organization provides deficient or substandard care_

_- The survivor cannot access the referral location_

_- Eligibility requirements make it difficult for the survivor to qualify for the service_

For this reason, it can be helpful to follow up with the survivor, if you have permission to do so,

*   1.  **Maintaining Referral Networks**

Maintain your referral network by regularly, at least every three months, contacting the agency or organization to confirm that the following are still correct:

_- The name of the organization_

_- The services being offered_

_- Their location and hours of operation_

**Keep informed and up-to-date about new services that may be offered, or new agencies or organizations that may offer them.**

If you are volunteering with a network of other advocates, communicate regularly about referrals and consider sharing documentation about what referrals are the most valuable and useful for survivors in your context and community.

**Documentation can also help to bring to your attention to gaps in services.**

Keep confidentiality central to these conversations. The survivors do not need to be discussed for referrals to be evaluated and shared.

1.  **Self-Care and Resiliency**

For advocates to continue our important work in the long-term, self-care is essential.

**By creating a self-care plan, you identify activities and practices to engage in regularly to maintain your health and well-being.**

The most effective self-care plan is personalized for your unique needs. It includes stress management, because although being an advocate is rewarding, it can be stressful at times.

Stress management techniques include:

- _Time management_: If we often feel time pressure to get our work done, or we feel behind or overwhelmed by tasks and responsibilities, it is easy to feel stress. Over time, stress becomes chronic and negatively affects our mental, emotional and physical health. It is important to consider how we manage our time as an element of self-care.

- _Maintaining boundaries_: Setting and maintaining healthy boundaries with survivors is essential. Overstepping these boundaries can lead to over-involvement with the survivor, which is unhealthy and unsustainable for your work as an advocate.

- _Eating right_: Diet has a profound effect on our ability to tolerate and respond to stress. Good nutrition can increase your stamina and strengthen your immune system. Eating a variety of fresh, whole foods as close to their natural state as possible is ideal.

- _Rest and relaxation_: Our physical, emotional and mental health require us to get enough sleep and time for relaxation. Often, when we feel time pressure, we often sacrifice this aspect of our self-care first, but it is extremely important.

- _Exercising_: Movement allows our bodies to release built-up stress and strengthens our immune system. Exercise regularly by doing an activity that you enjoy.

*   1.  **Building Resiliency**

As advocates, it is important to develop and strengthen your resiliency.

**Although you may be energized by the work you do, there are also negative effects such as vicarious trauma and burnout that you need to be aware of and protect yourself from.**

_Resiliency_**:** Resiliency is the ability to return to healthy functioning after being in a stressful situation. It is also considered the power to cope with adversity and adapt to challenges or change.

**Learning to identify and implement self-care strategies can help you to be resilient as you react to stress.**

**Self-care builds resiliency, so we will explore how to create a self-care plan that you can use alongside your advocacy work.**

Research has shown five core elements of resilience that we can develop as advocates:

1\. _Personal Perspective and Meaning_: Acknowledging the meaning that you attach to your work as an advocate and the challenges you face help keep you focused and self-aware. Maintaining your unique perspective and point of view as you navigate advocacy keeps you centered in your own experience and helps you avoid over-identifying with survivors.

2\. _A Sense of Hope_: A positive outlook and the belief that situations will improve are trademarks of an active hope that recognizes the challenges that survivors face while maintaining optimism in the face of these challenges.

3\. _Healthy Coping_: Being aware of the positive and negative aspects of your advocacy work helps you to see the impact that volunteering has on your emotional, mental and physical needs. With this awareness, you can proactively address negative feelings and develop positive and healthy coping mechanisms.

**4\. _Strong Relationships_: Positive relationships with others in our support network reduces the feeling of isolation that our work can sometimes have.**

5\. _Self-Knowledge and Insight_: Having a clear sense of your feelings and beliefs allows you to be who you are, instead of who others may want you to be. Understanding your strengths and weaknesses allows you to build on where you are already successful and seek support for your own personal development.

*   1.  **Stress-Related Conditions for Advocates**

**Being an advocate can be extremely stressful and result in emotional and physical stress-related conditions like burnout, vicarious trauma and compassion fatigue.**

**The good news is that because these are cumulative processes that happen over time, strong self-care and support networks can help to reduce our risk.**

_Burnout_: Exhaustion, cynicism and ineffectiveness are signs of a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal work stress often called burnout. It is a form of energy depletion that relates specifically to overwork and often results in someone leaving their position because they are unable to provide support for others any longer.

_Vicarious Trauma_**:** Service providers may experience a long-term stress response because of the physical and emotional stress of working with traumatized individuals.

By witnessing a survivor’s pain and trauma, the advocate can unintentionally take on that stress themselves. Hearing certain patterns in stories repeatedly can also be stressful. Over time, this can become a type of trauma associated with symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

_Compassion Fatigue_: When service providers have poor self-care and feel the need to self-sacrifice for their work, their efforts to empathize and be compassionate can end up creating an extreme state of tension and preoccupation with the suffering of others.

Service providers who are first responders are especially vulnerable to compassion fatigue. Women and people who show more empathy are more at risk, so it is important to learn how to leverage the asset of empathy with a sense of detachment, to protect the volunteer from being consumed by someone else’s story.

*   *   1.  **Symptoms of Stress-Related Conditions**

Symptoms of stress-related conditions are important to address immediately, because if left untreated the can have a very serious effect on your life and your health.

**It is important to be aware of these symptoms in yourself and others, so that you can create a supportive culture that encourages volunteers to reach out for help and support when they need it.**

**If you are experiencing any of these symptoms because of your work, your ability to be a strong advocate for survivors is compromised. Please take care of yourself first, and you can return to the work when you are able.**

It is important to think about and plan for how you will handle your feelings when you are in the role of advocating for a survivor.

**Whether we mean to or not, we carry residual stress from our interactions with survivors with us.**

These can trigger traumatic memories, cause nightmares or cause us to think back negatively about the person.

**It is also common for advocates to become preoccupied with issues related to sexual assault and intimate partner violence.**

There is a difference between educating yourself about the topic and becoming overly preoccupied with it.

Maybe you feel disoriented and notice that it is hard for you to focus in your life, or you become overly focused on or concerned about a survivor, wondering if you did a good enough job as an advocate.

Maybe you start to feel survivor’s guilt that none of the things that happened to the people you advocate for have happened to you, or you feel angry and hopeless at how dark and dangerous you feel the world is.

Maybe you become hyper-vigilant because of a fear of being sexually assaulted, lose your appetite or start to nub yourself with overeating, your sleep patterns change, or you start to experience strange pains in your body.

**These can all be emotional symptoms of stress-related conditions that are important to identify so that you can do something about them before they become serious.**

If you are working in a network of volunteers or with an organization, it is essential not to take on too much work.

The more cases we take on, the more likely it is that we carry those stories with us and become angry or exhausted.

**It is important that volunteering be a positive experience for advocates and only by addressing the challenges transparently and vulnerably can we create that.**

*   *   1.  **Risk Factors for Stress-Related Conditions**

All of us are vulnerable to burnout, vicarious trauma and compassion fatigue, but certain risk factors make some of us more vulnerable than others.

**By understanding our personal risk factors, it is easier to identify how to cope with stress more effectively.**

Here are some risk factors for stress-related conditions that advocates face:

**-** _Past Victimization_**:** If you are a survivor of sexual abuse, sexual assault, intimate partner violence or other trauma, unresolved issues could cloud your perspective as an advocate.

For example, you might over-identify with a survivor or take an overly protective role, attempting to rescue them or make decisions for them. You also might relive your own victimization.

Although these same experiences can be the ones that drive us to work for the rights of survivors and give us greater empathy for them, we need to be aware of how our personal story can intrude on our advocacy.

It is important to have a professional counselor to talk these issues through with as they come up.

_- Personal Life and Characteristics_: If you already have a high level of stress in other areas of your life, the stress of advocating for survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence may put a larger strain on you than others.

**Getting social support for yourself is essential.**

Belong to or create a network of trusted colleagues or friends with whom you can share about the stress of what you are doing without jeopardizing privacy or confidentiality.

**Manage advocacy boundaries, maintain realistic expectations of yourself and others, and be sure to leave lots of time in your life for resting and relaxing on your own and with family and friends.**

**- Work Environment**: The nature of advocacy is stressful. We hear horrible and graphic stories and frequently do not have closure or an opportunity to know how things worked out for the survivor in the long term. We may also feel overwhelmed with a sense of responsibility for survivors.

**Getting the support of other advocates is critical.**

If you are volunteering in a peer network or other organization, deliberately co-create a culture of support and be sure advocates are giving themselves adequate time off.

**- Context**: It is natural for sexual assault and intimate partner violence survivors to feel insecure and have trouble trusting or accepting.

They may react to advocates with mistrust, a sense of distance and a lack of gratitude that can be confusing to advocates. You may feel annoyed, angry, unappreciated or manipulated.

You also might find it stressful to interact with survivors from different cultures who don’t act the way you expect, who fear the police and judicial system, and who may reject your assistance.

This can be frustrating and stressful, especially over time.
