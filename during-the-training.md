# During the Training

**Due to the sensitive nature of this training material, it is important to take care of yourself while you are learning.**

Here are some suggestions for self-care as you navigate what can be triggering and upsetting information:

_- Take it slow and move at a pace that feels comfortable to you._

_- Make more time for relaxing and doing activities that you enjoy._

_- Make sure to get enough rest, drink plenty of water and nourish yourself with healthy food._

_- If you feel strong feelings because of the training, take a few minutes to focus on slowing down your breathing. Exhale longer than your inhale and feel yourself breathing from your belly. Do this for a few minutes, until your strong feelings have passed._
